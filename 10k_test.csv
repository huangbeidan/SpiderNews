2018/5/30,Top North Korean official heads to U.S. for pre-summit talks,"A top North Korean official headed to New York on Wednesday for talks aimed at salvaging a summit between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump on the future of Kim`s nuclear program, in the North`s highest-level mission to the United States in 18 years.Associated Press reporters saw Kim Yong Chol at Beijing`s airport just after noon. South Korea`s Yonhap news agency cited diplomatic sources as saying that Kim was on an Air China flight to New York that departed later Wednesday afternoon.Yonhap said Kim, who had arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, was traveling with five other North Korean officials.Kim, one of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un`s most trusted aides, is a former military intelligence chief and now a vice chairman of the ruling party`s central committee.North Korea`s mission to the United Nations in New York is its sole diplomatic presence in the United States. That suggests Kim might have chosen to first go to New York because it would make it easier for him to communicate with officials in Pyongyang, North Korea`s capital. North Korea and the United States are still technically at war and have no diplomatic ties because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treatyMr. Trump confirmed Tuesday that Kim was to hold talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But it wasn`t immediately known what else he would do in the United States. South Korean media speculated that he was carrying a personal letter from Kim Jong Un and may push to travel to Washington to meet with Mr. Trump.Pompeo has traveled to Pyongyang twice in recent weeks for meetings with Kim Jong Un, and has said there is a ""shared understanding"" between the two sides about what they hope to achieve in talks. South Korean media speculated that Pompeo could make a third trip to Pyongyang after Kim Yong Chol`s U.S. trip.Mr. Trump and Kim Jong Un were set to hold their summit June 12 in Singapore, but Mr. Trump announced last week that he was pulling out of the meeting. Since then, he has suggested the summit could be back on, and Kim Yong Chol`s trip to the U.S. seems to imply that preparations for a meeting could be in the final stages.Kim Yong Chol`s trip comes amid two sets of other pre-summit talks between Washington and Pyongyang.A team of U.S. officials led by former U.S. nuclear negotiator Sung Kim began talks with North Korean officials at the Korean border village of Panmunjom on Sunday to set the agenda for the summit.A North Korean delegation led by another of Kim Jong Un`s trusted aides, Kim Chang Son, flew to Singapore on Monday night for talks with U.S. officials to discuss logistical issues for the summit. Details of those talks hadn`t emerged yet.North Korea`s flurry of diplomatic activity following a torrid run in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests that Kim Jong Un is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and the international legitimacy the summit with Trump would provide. But there are lingering doubts on whether Kim will every fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.While there have been a few instances in which countries were persuaded to abandon their nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief and compensation, none of the cases are directly applicable to North Korea, which has advanced its nukes further and with greater zeal than any of the others. The North`s arsenal now includes purported thermonuclear warheads and developmental long-range missiles potentially capable of reaching mainland U.S. cities.But South Korea, which has lobbied hard for the talks between Trump and Kim, has insisted that Kim can be persuaded to abandon his nuclear facilities, materials and bombs in a verifiable and irreversible way if offered credible security and economic guarantees.China, North Korea`s longtime ally and chief trading partner, has sought to position itself as a key intermediary in talks over Pyongyang`s nuclear weapons program. Beijing backs the North`s proposal for a phased and synchronized denuclearization process, while the United States insists on a comprehensive one-shot deal in which North Korea eliminates its nukes first and receives rewards later.Russia said Wednesday that its foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, will travel to North Korea for talks on Thursday.Kim Yong Chol would be the highest-level North Korean official to travel to the United States since 2000, when Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok visited Washington and met President Bill Clinton amid warming ties between the wartime foes. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a historic reciprocal visit to Pyongyang later in 2000 in a bid to arrange a North Korea visit by Clinton. Ties turned sour again after President George W. Bush took office in early 2001 with a tough policy on the North.Kim Yong Chol`s official title is a vice chairman of the central committee of the ruling Workers` Party. Previously, he was a four-star army general and a military intelligence chief who is thought to have been behind two deadly attacks in 2010 that killed 50 South Koreans and an alleged 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Both Seoul and Washington imposed sanctions on him in recent years."
2018/5/30,"Trump, critics exchange angry immigration charges, falsehoods","President Donald Trump and Democratic critics traded outraged, sometimes plainly false accusations about immigration as the debate over ""lost"" children and the practice of separating families caught crossing the border illegally reached a new boiling point.The White House on Tuesday wrongly blamed Democrats for forcing Mr. Trump`s administration to separate children from parents. Liberal activists and others, including some from media outlets, tried to highlight the issue by tweeting photos of young people in steel cages that actually were taken during the Obama administration. Others seized on reports the government had ""lost"" more than 1,000 children, though that wasn`t quite the case.It all comes just in time for the midterm elections as Republicans and Democrats try to rally core voters by pointing fingers at one another. Mr. Trump won the presidency promising to build a wall along the southern border and end illegal immigration, and the White House believes stressing the same issues will drive voters to the polls and help the GOP hang on to their majorities in the Senate and House.The White House is ""really beating the immigration drum in the lead-up to the midterm elections as a rallying cry and as a way of mobilizing voter support for Trump and the candidates that he chooses,"" said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute and former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton administration. ""It does seem to provoke a ratcheting up across the board.""Indeed, the situation grew so hostile over the holiday weekend that the president`s elder daughter, White House adviser Ivanka Trump, came under fire for tweeting a photo of herself and her youngest son in their pajamas Sunday morning.""Focus on what is before you, on what you can control and ignore the trolls!"" she later wrote.During a White House conference call Tuesday, senior adviser Stephen Miller contended ""the current immigration and border crisis"" is ""the exclusive product of loopholes in federal immigration law that Democrats refuse to close.""That was after Mr. Trump lit up social media over the weekend by falsely claiming there was a ""horrible law"" that separates children from their parents after they cross the border illegally. He had said previously that ""we have to break up families"" at the border because ""the Democrats gave us that law.""But there`s no law mandating that parents must be separated from their children, and it`s not a policy Democrats have pushed or can change alone as the minority in Congress. The tactic`s increased use is being driven by Mr. Trump`s administration, which recently announced a new ""zero-tolerance policy"" in which it will press criminal charges against all people crossing the border illegally, even if they have few or no previous offenses. More children are expected to be separated from their parents as a result.A Customs and Border Protection official told lawmakers last week that 658 children had been separated from their parents at the border from May 6 to May 19 as the parents face charges. That`s in addition to hundreds more who were estimated to have been removed from their parents since October.The practice has drawn condemnation from Trump critics, who have long accused him of supporting inhumane policies in his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.""He actually called the practice horrible. If he thinks it`s so horrible then he ought to just end it and not make the children a negotiating tool,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union`s Immigrants` Rights Project.""It`s never a good idea to separate small children from their parents,"" said Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla. ""I cannot defend that, nor do I wish to.""Curbelo is a leader of GOP lawmakers trying to force House immigration votes next month over leaders` objections.Trump foes made their own missteps in the debate.Over the weekend, some critics of the policy tweeted photos of young-looking immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in steel cages and blamed the Trump administration for separating immigrant children from their parents. The problem: The photos were taken by The Associated Press in 2014, when Barack Obama was in office, and the photo captions reference children who crossed the border as unaccompanied minors.How or why the story resurfaced on social media four years after it was published was unclear. But Trump seized on the error.""Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama`s term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country ... Bipartisan Bill!""It`s unclear what ""Bipartisan Bill!"" Trump might have been referring to.Congress is heading toward an immigration showdown in the House as Republican moderates force a June vote on legislation to protect young ""Dreamer"" immigrants and beef up border security.GOP leaders are trying to stop the bill, which has robust support from Democrats and some Republicans. They`re worried any legislation that smacks of ""amnesty"" for immigrants in the U.S. illegally would dampen conservative enthusiasm ahead of the midterms.Instead, House Speaker Paul Ryan and his leadership team are trying to put together an alternative approach that most Republicans would support. But finding common ground remains difficult. Trump so far has not engaged in the Capitol Hill debate, even as he repeatedly insists Congress must act.Also making the rounds on social media over the holiday weekend: Allegations that children placed in custody have been ""lost"" by federal authorities, which officials say isn`t the case.The allegation, which sparked #WhereAreOurChildren on Twitter, grew out of testimony in April by a federal official that the government had lost track of nearly 1,500 unaccompanied minor children it placed with adult sponsors in the U.S.An official from the Health and Human Services Department told a congressional hearing last month that his department placed follow-up phone calls from October to December to U.S. households that were sponsoring minors who crossed the border without their parents. They reached 86 percent of the children or sponsors, but the department could not verify the whereabouts of 1,475. In some cases, sponsors simply didn`t respond to the follow-up phone call, not surprising because many are themselves in the U.S. illegally and reluctant to speak to authorities.""If you call a friend and they don`t answer the phone, you don`t assume that they`ve been kidnapped,"" HHS` Steven Wagner said.Officials said Tuesday they are planning more thorough screening of both minors and their sponsors, including a fingerprint background check of every sponsor."

2018/5/31,Incomprehensible: Bus driver gets max sentence for molesting special needs children,"LAS VEGAS -- A former Clark County School District bus driver has been sentenced to life in prison with possibility of parole after 35 years for molesting special needs children, the maximum sentence possible. KSNV-TV reported Wednesday that Michael Banco was convicted of molesting the children that were 3 and 4 years old.He initially faced 41 counts, but pleaded guilty last month to one count each of sexual assault with a minor under 16 and lewdness with a child under 14, reports the Las Vegas Review Journal.Prosecutors called it the most horrific case they`ve ever seen. Judge Elisa Cadish called the crimes ""incomprehensible"" when sentencing Banco.Some of the incidents were caught on bus surveillance cameras. On three separate days, according to the paper, the camera recorded images Of Banco molesting and assaulting ""very small"" children in the back of a bus before dropping them off at school, according to the Review Journal. He was arrested in 2015.Chief Deputy District Attorney Sam Martinez called the crimes ""depraved"" and ""horrible.""""He knew exactly what he was doing,"" Martinez said, according to the paper. ""....These little girls will have to live with this the rest of their lives.""The mother of one of the victims reportedly said in court that her daughter still has nightmares. Another woman whose granddaughter was 3 at the time of the attacks called the child a hero for telling her family about Banco`s actions.""This man has destroyed my granddaughter,"" the woman told the judge. ""How do we get past that? I don`t know what else to do, but hug her. That`s all I have."""
2018/6/1,A look back at Roseanne Barr`s most controversial moments,"Roseanne Barr`s recent controversy, in which the actress compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape, is not her first. The comedian has a history of stirring controversy and making troubling comments. Here`s a look back at her most notorious moments.Barr`s national anthem disasterBarr angered many when made a joke of the national anthem at a Cincinnati Reds vs. San Diego Padres baseball game in 1990, purposely singing out of tune and making faces. She also grabbed her crotch during the performance.Incest claimsIn 1991, Barr claimed that she was an incest survivor and was abused by both parents. Later, in 2011, she recanted to Oprah Winfrey and said she was under the influence of drugs at the time she made the claim.Hitler photosIn 2009, Barr, who is Jewish, dressed up as Adolf Hitler in a photoshoot for Heeb, a Jewish satirical magazine. In the pictures, Barr is dressed like Hitler and wears a mustache, and is pulling ""Jew cookies"" out of the oven.Barr criticizes Marie Osmond after her son`s suicideIn 2010, Barr slammed Marie Osmond after the latter`s 18-year-old son died by suicide. She claimed Osmond`s son was gay and said, ""He had been told how wrong and how sick he was every day of his life by his church and the people in it. Calling that `depression` is a lie!""Barr retweets George Zimmerman`s parents` home addressIn 2012, Barr retweeted the home address of George Zimmerman, the man who shot and killed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin and was acquitted of murder. She deleted the tweet, but then threatened that if Zimmerman wasn`t arrested, she would tweet his address again and ""maybe go 2 his house myself."" Zimmerman`s parents sued her, but a judge dismissed the lawsuit.Barr tweets conspiracy theoriesBarr has tweeted her support of conspiracy theories like ""pizzagate."" She also claimed billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish and a Holocaust survivor, was a Nazi, and that Chelsea Clinton is related to him, neither of which is true. Barr also compared Obama adviser Susan Rice, who is black, to an ape in 2013, but the tweet did not cause as much of a firestorm as her tweet comparing Jarrett to an ape.ABC canceled ""Roseanne"" Tuesday after Barr tweeted about Jarrett writing ""muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj."" Despite the show`s high ratings, ABC canceled it within hours and issued a statement saying ""Roseanne`s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values."" Since then, she has apologized, but also said that her fans make her feel like ""fighting back."""
2018/6/1,"Canada, Mexico, EU retaliate against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs","Key U.S. economic allies are firing back with retaliatory trade measures following the Trump administration`s move to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.Canada`s government on Thursday announced plans to levy tariffs on products including American-made steel and aluminum. That policy will continue so long as the U.S. tariffs remain in force.The White House has said the U.S. tariffs -- 25 percent duties on steel and 10 percent on aluminum shipments from Canada, EU member states and Mexico -- are necessary to safeguard U.S. national security.In announcing his country`s response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was ""inconceivable"" that Canada ""could be considered a national security threat to the United States,"" noting that U.S. fighter planes and tanks contain Canadian steel.""These tariffs will harm industries and workers on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border and will disrupt supply chains that have made steel and aluminum from North America more competitive across the whole world,"" he said in a press conference in Ottawa.Effective July 1, Canada will impose tariffs of 25 percent on shipments of U.S. steel and 10 percent on aluminum, as well as on other products, such as playing cards, inflatable boats and yogurt. Canada`s finance ministry estimated the value of the U.S. goods subject to those tariffs at up to C$16.6 billion ($12.8 billion),Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said the European Union also will apply news tariffs on American goods, with the trading bloc signaling it would target products made in states represented by key Republican leaders. The EU has said it would respond with tariffs on $3.3 billion in American imports as early as June 20.""The U.S. now leaves us with no choice but to proceed with a [World Trade Organization] dispute settlement case and with the imposition of additional duties on a number of imports from the U.S. We will defend the Union`s interests, in full compliance with international trade law,"" Juncker said in a statement.In March, the EU made public a 10-page list of possible targets. The extensive lineup includes an array of agricultural products, including rice and tobacco, as well as automobiles and motorcycles, whiskey, paper products, shoes, and blue jeans.""Everybody loses in a protracted trade war, we encourage countries to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and to resolve trade disagreements without resort to exceptional measures,"" a spokesperson for the International Monetary Fund said in a statement. ""It is unfortunate that trade tensions are rising at a moment where the global recovery is being supported by trade.""Mexico`s government said Thursday it would levy taxes on imported U.S. products including pork bellies, apples and cheese, along with some types of steel.""Mexico reiterates its position against protectionist measures that affect and distort international merchandise trade,"" the government said in a statement.Bad news that @POTUS has decided to impose taxes on American consumers buying steel and aluminum from our closest allies--Canada, the EU, and Mexico (with whom we run a trade surplus on steel). In addition to higher prices, these tariffs invite retaliation. ‰ÛÓ Senator Pat Toomey (@SenToomey) May 31, 2018Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, tweeted from the G7 Symposium in Whistler, Canada, saying: ""At the end of the day, if #trade is massively disrupted, if the level of trust among economic actors is severely damaged, those who will suffer most are the poorest people #G7.""In addition to swift denouncements from U.S. allies, the Trump tariffs were bashed by some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan.""Instead of addressing the real problems in the international trade of these products, today`s action targets America`s allies when we should be working with them to address the unfair trading practices of countries like China,"" he said. ""There are better ways to help American workers and consumers.""Sen. Ben Sasse was blunter in criticizing the tariffs.""This is dumb. Europe, Canada and Mexico are not China, and you don`t treat allies the same way you treat opponents,"" the Nebraska Republican said in a statement. ""We`ve been down this road before -- blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression. `Make America Great Again` shouldn`t mean `Make America 1929 Again.` """
2018/6/1,Trump mulls changes to Jerusalem consulate responsible for Palestinian relations,"President Trump is considering giving U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman more authority over the U.S. outpost that handles Palestinian affairs, five U.S. officials said, a shift that could further dampen Palestinian hopes for an independent state.Any move to downgrade the autonomy of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem ‰ÛÓ responsible for relations with the Palestinians ‰ÛÓ could have potent symbolic resonance, suggesting American recognition of Israeli control over east Jerusalem and the West Bank. And while the change might be technical and bureaucratic, it could have potentially significant policy implications.As president, Mr. Trump has departed from traditional U.S. insistence on a ""two-state solution"" for the Mideast conflict by leaving open the possibility of just one state. As his administration prepares to unveil a long-awaited peace plan, the Palestinians have all but cut off contact, enraged by Mr. Trump`s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.The deliberations come as Friedman, who has pushed for changes to the consulate since he arrived in Israel last year, faces growing indignation in the U.S. over partisan comments and other actions in which he has publicly sided with Israel over its critics. On Thursday, a top Democratic lawmaker even suggested Friedman should be recalled after he waded into domestic U.S. politics on Israel`s behalf, telling an Israeli newspaper that Democrats have failed to support Israel as much as Republicans.For decades, the Jerusalem consulate has operated differently than almost every other consulate around the world. Rather than reporting to the U.S. Embassy in Israel, it has reported directly to the State Department in Washington, giving the Palestinians an unfiltered channel to engage with the U.S. government.That arrangement was relatively clear-cut before Mr. Trump moved the embassy. Until Mr. Trump`s decision in December to move it from Tel Aviv, the United States did not recognize Jerusalem as Israel`s capital. The Jerusalem consulate provided services to Americans in Jerusalem and also served as the de facto U.S. embassy to the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem for the capital of a future independent state.But since Mr. Trump earlier this month moved the embassy to Jerusalem, the situation has become more complicated. Now the U.S. maintains an embassy in one part of the city and a separate consulate less than a mile away, potentially creating confusion about who has ultimate authority if, for example, an American citizen needs help and turns to the U.S. government.No final decision has been made about what changes to make to the consulate`s chain of command, a decision complicated by the consulate`s unique circumstances. But the embassy, run by Friedman, is expected to end up with ultimate authority over the consulate, officials said. They weren`t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity.Dan Shapiro, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, said such a move would be perceived as undermining Palestinians` claims to sovereignty and statehood aspirations, because it would suggest that Washington considers the Palestinian Authority to be under Israel`s jurisdiction. Otherwise, Shapiro said, why would it expect the Palestinians to talk to the U.S. through its mission to Israel?""They don`t want to deal with the U.S. embassy to Israel as their channel,"" said Shapiro, now a scholar at Israel`s Institute for National Security Studies. ""They want their voice to be heard directly in Washington.""GettyTypically, the head of a consulate, known as a consul general, reports to the ambassador, who has ""chief of mission authority"" over all U.S. posts in the country. In contrast, the consul general running the Jerusalem consulate has historically had his or her own chief of mission authority. The closest comparable case to the Jerusalem situation is the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong, which also has its own chief of mission who does not report to the U.S. ambassador in Beijing.Friedman has advocated for having the embassy in Jerusalem subsume the consulate, officials said, although the State Department has ruled out that possibility. Other possibilities include allowing the consulate to retain some day-to-day authorities while letting the embassy set the direction for major policy decisions.Staunchly pro-Israel and with close ties to the West Bank settler movement, Friedman is broadly seen by Palestinian leadership as lacking good faith in U.S. efforts to mediate a fair resolution to the Mideast conflict. But on the consulate issue, he has an ally in the White House in the form of national security adviser John Bolton, the officials said.It wasn`t clear precisely when the changes would be made, although one official said the administration is waiting until current Consul General Donald Blome leaves Jerusalem over the summer, possibly in July.Regardless of any changes, the Jerusalem consulate will remain the primary U.S. point of contact for the Palestinian Authority and for Palestinians, including those in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip seeking visas or other U.S. consular services.""Consulate General Jerusalem continues to operate as an independent mission with an unchanged mandate from its historic Agron Road location,"" the State Department said in a statement.Such changes would likely be carried out by Mr. Trump issuing new ""letters of instruction,"" which delegate authorities to ambassadors and chiefs of mission, to Friedman and whoever heads the Jerusalem consulate, the official said.Separately, the Trump administration is also facing calls in Congress for the U.S. to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Although Israel annexed the Golan in 1981, the U.S. and others consider it to be disputed territory with its status subject to an eventual peace deal between Israel and Syria.In recent months, however, Iran`s increasing involvement in Syria and growing presence in southern Syria near the Golan Heights have drawn alarm in Israel and elsewhere, leading some U.S. law- and policy-makers to believe that the Washington should end its official neutrality in a show of support for Israeli security in the face of a threat from Iran and its proxies.Ideas under discussion range from flat-out recognition that the Golan is part of Israel to lifting restrictions on U.S. investment incentives for projects or more symbolic steps like including the area on official maps as part of Israel."

2018/6/2,"Stage is set for California`s ""jungle primary"" Tuesday","SACRAMENTO, Calif.‰ÛÓ Across televisions in Orange County, a flashy ad slams GOP congressional candidate Rocky Chavez for supporting a California climate change program and a massive state budget.But it`s not one of Chavez`s Republican rivals who`s criticizing him for siding on issues with Democrats such as Gov. Jerry Brown. It`s Democrats themselves.Welcome to Tuesday`s ""jungle primary,"" where the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advance to the general election. That means neither Democrats nor Republicans are guaranteed a spot on the November ballot. Candidates and parties are scrambling to avoid potential shutouts.Democrats worry two Republicans could make the runoff in several U.S. House contests, which explains why a national Democratic campaign organization is airing ads aimed at undermining Chavez with the GOP base. Republicans are all but guaranteed to be locked out of the U.S. Senate contest and are fighting tooth and nail to win a slot in the governor`s race.""It`s definitely been a disruptive force in California politics, and we`re just learning about some of the pros and cons,"" said Mark Baldasarre, president of the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.Californians voted to create the top-two primary system in 2010 at the urging of supporters such as then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who said it would encourage candidates to adopt more moderate positions rather than appeal to their party`s most extreme voters.But there`s little evidence that`s happening, according to PPIC researcher Eric McGhee, who found GOP candidates aren`t becoming more moderate. Democrats are in some cases, he said, but that could be due to factors such as redistricting.Only Washington state uses a similar system, which some call the ""jungle primary"" because of the free-for-all nature of having all candidates running against each other on one ballot.In the governor`s race, San Diego businessman John Cox is courting hardcore conservatives. He is promoting his endorsement from President Trump and promising to scale back protections for immigrants living in the country illegally, though such stands don`t appeal to a broad segment of California voters.Cox is fighting for the second slot against former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat whose backers are portraying Cox as a secret Democrat in order to depress his support among Republicans. At the same time, front-runner Gavin Newsom is running ads aimed at boosting Cox, presuming he`ll be an easier general election rival.This type of cross-party tangling isn`t new. Candidates long have tried to boost their weakest potential general election opponent. But the top-two system has elevated the stakes and added a more chaotic, less predictable element to the contests.""With a closed primary, it`s a little bit of chess. With a jungle primary, it`s more like three- or four-dimensional chess,"" said Jim Brulte, chairman of the California Republican Party.In the Senate contest, 26-year incumbent Dianne Feinstein is shifting to the left in the face of a challenge from state Sen. Kevin de Leon, who argues she hasn`t done enough to stand up to Trump. In recent weeks, she reversed her long-held support for the death penalty and softened her opposition to legal marijuana.In the past, a strong incumbent such as Feinstein could have largely ignored a lesser-known foe from the left, knowing she would make it through the primary and face a Republican. But with the top-two primary system and no serious Republican challengers, de Leon is likely to be a thorn in her side all the way into November.With Republicans` clout rapidly fading in California, failing to have general election candidates for the Senate and governor`s races could prove disastrous for the party`s hopes of keeping control of House seats and winning state legislative contests.Democrats need to pick up about two dozen seats to flip the majority in the House, and three to have a majority in the Senate. In 2016, when no Republican was in the Senate race, about 2 million Californians who voted for president took a pass on the Senate race, Baldasarre said.""You`ve got a much larger group of people who feel alienated because they`re not represented,"" he said.But Garry South, a longtime adviser to former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and a staunch advocate of the top-two primary system, said general elections with candidates from only one party can actually benefit voters. The state leans so heavily Democratic that, in statewide races, forcing two candidates within that party to debate each other can be more productive than letting one Democrat cruise unscathed to victory, he said.""In a one-party state, which we have basically become, having same-party runoffs is kind of what you have to do to protect the voters` right to make a decision,"" he said.While such a system benefits Democrats at the statewide level, it has its perks for Republicans, too.Take Orange County, where polling indicates Republicans could see two candidates in the November election in three House seats that Democrats badly need to win if they want to take back the House.That`s led a scramble to take down candidates such as Chavez, even with messages that are seemingly anathema to the party`s priorities.""Human nature is very inventive,"" South said. ""And particularly when it comes to politics, there will always be people gaming the system."""
2018/6/2,"Steel and aluminum tariffs fight only a ""family quarrel,"" Larry Kudlow says","President Donald Trump`s chief economic adviser is downplaying the escalating trade battles with a host of U.S. allies, describing the dispute over steel and aluminum tariffs as a ""family quarrel.""Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters on Friday that he remains optimistic about the outcome of negotiations with Canada, Europe and Mexico in spite of recent escalations.""[T]his is what I regard as a family quarrel, and the conversations are wide open and could well be solved in the months ahead as the conversations continue.""Mr. Trump this week announced a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union.""Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time,"" he said in a tweet Friday claiming that the country has a trade surplus with the U.S.Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time.

Effective July 1, Canada will impose tariffs of 25 percent on shipments of U.S. steel and 10 percent on aluminum, as well as on other products, worth up to C$16.6 billion ($12.8 billion).In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron called the decision to levy tariffs on European Union member states ""illegal"" and a ""mistake.""

2018/6/2,"Ex-NFL cheerleaders sue Houston Texans, allege intimidation and low pay","HOUSTON -- Five former NFL cheerleaders sued the Houston Texans on Friday, alleging the team failed to fully compensate them as required by law and subjected them to a hostile work environment in which they were harassed, intimidated and forced to live in fear. The lawsuit, filed in Houston federal court, accuses the franchise of paying the women less than the $7.25 per hour they were promised, not compensating them for making public appearances or performing other tasks related to their jobs and creating a workplace where the women were threatened with being fired for voicing any complaints.""I and my fellow cheerleaders were treated as the lowest of the low,"" Hannah Turnbow said at a news conference. ""The Houston Texans were paid thousands of dollars to have us show up at appearances at locations all over Texas with no security, no transportation and where our safety was not guaranteed.""Turnbow said that after she was left with abrasions on her shoulder when she was attacked by a fan at one game, the team told her ""to just suck it up.""""We were harassed, bullied and body shamed for $7.25 an hour,"" said ex-cheerleader Ainsley Parish.Texans spokeswoman Amy Palcic said the team is constantly evaluating its cheerleader program and makes changes ""as needed to make the program enjoyable for everyone.""""We are proud of the cheerleader program and have had hundreds of women participate and enjoy their experience while making a positive impact in the local community,"" Palcic said in a brief statement.Prominent women`s rights attorney Gloria Allred, who`s representing the cheerleaders, alleged the women were paid ""so little or not paid at all"" for much of the work they did because of their gender.""Surely (Texans owner Bob) McNair and the Houston Texans can find it in their budget of hundreds of millions of dollars to pay these women a fair wage, not minimum wage,"" Allred said. ""I say, stop penny pinching. Pay these women what they deserve and make sure you pay them for every minute that they work.""The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages.This is the second such lawsuit filed against the Texans.Last month, three ex-cheerleaders also filed suit in Houston federal court, accusing the Texans of not paying them minimum wage, not paying overtime wages and accusing a cheerleading supervisor of body shaming them.These lawsuits are part of a series of recent complaints that have been made by cheerleaders against NFL teams across the country.The New York Times reported last month that on a trip to Costa Rica for a photo shoot in 2013, Washington Redskins cheerleaders had their passports collected, were forced to be topless for a calendar photo shoot that included male spectators and were asked to be escorts for sponsors at a nightclub.Former cheerleaders with the Miami Dolphins and the New Orleans Saints also have filed recent discriminatory complaints and lawsuits against their ex-teams.Last year, a federal judge in California dismissed a lawsuit that had been filed by a former San Francisco 49ers cheerleader who had accused the NFL and team owners of conspiring to suppress wages for cheerleaders.Allred said she planned next week to present a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking him to review the complaints being made by her clients and other cheerleaders about their working conditions."
2018/6/2,"Rhode Island bans bump stocks, joining neighboring states","PROVIDENCE, R.I. ‰ÛÓ Rhode Island joined its neighbors on Friday in banning devices that enable semi-automatic weapons to mimic a fully automatic one.Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo signed the bump stock ban bill as well as a ""red flag"" bill, which will allow law enforcement to request orders to remove guns temporarily from people it deems dangerous.""There`s no question that we need these laws, there`s no question that it`s common-sense, and no question that they`ll make us safer,"" Raimondo said in a ceremony at the statehouse.The proposals cleared the last hurdle in the General Assembly on Thursday. Lawmakers in Connecticut enacted a bump stock ban Thursday. Massachusetts did so last year. Rhode Island`s laws take effect immediately.Lawmakers attributed both laws to concern about specific mass shootings. About a dozen bump stocks were found in the hotel room of the shooter who killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more at a Las Vegas country music festival in October 2017.Both legislators who sponsored Rhode Island`s ban said they didn`t know what bump stocks were until they watched media coverage of the Las Vegas shooting.Democratic Rep. Robert Craven, a former prosecutor, said the sound of the gunfire led him to ask an associate to ""go on the computer and find out what the hell a bump stock is."" Sen. James Seveney, a Democrat and retired naval officer, said guns with bump stocks don`t belong in the public.""These are weapons of war and they don`t belong anywhere else but in our armed services,"" he said.The red flag law grew out of concern about the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. Police had received 18 calls about the shooter before the event.Florida, along with Maryland, Vermont and now Rhode Island, has since enacted a red flag policy.The Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association pushed for the policy here. The law will allow law enforcement to petition the Superior Court for the temporary order."
2018/6/3,"Police: Shooting death of Steven Pitt, forensic psychiatrist, linked to killings of 2 women","SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- The shooting death of a prominent forensic psychiatrist who assisted in high-profile murder cases including serial killings in Phoenix is connected to the slayings of two paralegals, said authorities, who were looking into a possible fourth homicide Saturday. Police in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale said the slayings Friday of Veleria Sharp, 48, and Laura Anderson, 49, were related to the fatal shooting a day earlier of Dr. Steven Pitt.Sgt. Ben Hoster would not disclose what connected the three victims.""I can`t get into the specifics of that,"" Hoster said, citing the ongoing investigation.Witnesses heard a loud argument and gunfire Thursday outside Pitt`s Scottsdale office. Phoenix police have been investigating the shooting and previously said they had no information on whether the killing was related to Pitt`s work.Sharp and Anderson were both shot inside a law office Friday afternoon. According to Scottsdale police, one of the women managed to walk to an intersection for help despite suffering a gunshot wound to the head. She was taken to a hospital where she died. Officers, meanwhile, followed a blood trail back to the business and found the other woman. She was pronounced dead at the scene from a gunshot wound.Scottsdale police received a call early Saturday about a man found fatally shot inside a business. Hoster did not identify the victim, who was discovered by someone known to him. The killing occurred in an office park that houses mostly therapists and counselors.Hoster said it was not yet known if this death was related to the others.Pitt, 59, assisted in the investigation into the 1996 death of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead at her home in Boulder, Colorado.A decade later, he helped Phoenix police in the Baseline Killer investigation as they sought a man who was later convicted of killing nine people."

2018/6/4,"Steph Curry dazzles from deep, Warriors take 2-0 NBA Finals lead","OAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Curry hit an NBA Finals-record nine 3-pointers and scored 33 points, leading the Golden State Warriors to a 122-103 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night. The Warriors now have a 2-0 lead over the Cavs.""It`s hard to think back to all the games, but he was tremendous -- nine 3s and seemed to hit a big shot every time we needed one,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""He was fantastic.""Kevin Durant found his steady stroke to score 26 points to go with nine rebounds and seven assists while also handling a load of the defensive assignment against LeBron James. Klay Thompson added 20 points playing on a tender left leg to put the defending champions two victories from a repeat title they have talked about since the season began last fall.The Warriors tweeted out a break down of the total points from Sunday`s game:Final _ÙÒ_ Steph - 33p/8a/7rKevin - 26p/9r/7a/2bKlay - 20p/2rJaVale - 12p/2rShaun - 10p/5rDraymond - 8r/7a/5p ‰ÛÓ Golden State Warriors (@warriors) June 4, 2018James followed up his 51-point performance in Game 1 with 29 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds in a far tamer finals sequel minus the utter craziness of a drama-packed opener three days prior.Game 3 is Wednesday night in Cleveland.Kevin Love had 22 points and 10 boards for the cold-shooting Cavs, who will now try to gain some momentum back home.Curry had the shot of the night with 7:54 to play, making an off-balance swish from several feet behind the 3-point arc over Love as the shot clock wound down, then backpedaled in pure joy. Curry fell into the first row of fans with a baseline 3 again over Love and four-point play at the 5:44 mark of the fourth.""He makes tough shots, that`s what he does,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. ""... Once he releases it and he sees the basket, he usually makes it.""James pointed with both hands after his 3 with 11:04 remaining got his team within seven, before Curry answered from deep the next two trips down the floor. Curry squatted low to admire his shot as it went in at one point and galloped back in joy after he hit two deep 3s late in the first half.GettyThey had a tense moment in the third, too.James became irate at the officials for a no-call on Curry, who ran beneath the Cavs star and didn`t let him land with 3:54 remaining in the quarter as James caught Love`s long pass and went out of bounds. Lue was hit with a technical, saying afterward he didn`t say much but was on the court.JaVale McGee scored 12 points, making all six of his shots in his first career NBA Finals start as Kerr made a lineup switch that proved spot on.The typically efficient Durant connected on 10 of 14 shots after going just 8 for 22 -- 1 of 7 on 3s -- in the opener but still scoring 26 points.Last year`s NBA Finals MVP made his initial five field goals Sunday, driving right at James on offense and doing all he could to fluster him on defense.James hit a 3 over Durant`s outstretched arm midway through the third, then Tristan Thompson`s basket the next possession pulled the Cavs within 72-66. But they couldn`t contain Curry and the rest of the Warriors for extended stretches.The Warriors vowed to make it harder for James to generate good looks after he shot 19 for 32 in the series opener, and James went 12:06 of game time between made baskets.James went 10 for 20, showing few signs his shot was altered by a bloodshot left eye. He had been taking antibiotics and using drops after being poked in the eye by Draymond Green in the first half Thursday.The Warriors earned a wacky 124-114 overtime win in Game 1 Thursday night -- featuring J.R. Smith`s blunder when he grabbed an offensive rebound in the waning moments of regulation and dribbled back toward halfcourt rather than shooting for the victory, and an overturned charge call against James.Smith received rousing cheers from the home fans during pregame introductions and ""M-V-P!"" chants greeted him when he went to the foul line.Thompson played after bruising his lower left leg when Smith slid into him in the first quarter Thursday. The Warriors All-Star has never missed a postseason game.Kerr went with 7-foot big man McGee to start in place of Kevon Looney - McGee`s 10th career start in the postseason.McGee scored the first four points as Golden State made its initial seven shots and 10 of 11. That included Thompson`s steal from James at the 3-point line leading to Green`s dunk moments later and a Cleveland timeout down 15-6 at the 8:14 mark.McGee`s five baskets through 26 minutes matched James` total.Another key role player, Shaun Livingston, made his five field-goal tries for 10 points to give Golden State a lift in the first half after making all four of his shots Thursday.Tip-insCavaliers: James` first-half line: 15 points, eight assists, seven rebounds, two steals. His first points -- the first for Cleveland -- came on a goaltend by McGee. ... After holding a 19-4 edge on the offensive glass in Game 1, the Cavs were 15-7 on Sunday.Warriors: Thompson played in his franchise-record 100th postseason game. He also became the sixth player to ever make 300 3s in the postseason, joining Curry as the Warriors to reach the feat. ... The Warriors were 13 of 15 from inside the arc in the opening quarter. They shot 59.5 percent in the first half despite going 6 of 19 on 3s. They finished 15 for 36 from long range. ... Golden State is 13-3 in postseason Game 2s dating to the 2015 title run.Iguodala still outWarriors forward Andre Iguodala missed his sixth straight postseason game nursing a bone bruise in his left knee.Kerr remains optimistic the 2015 NBA Finals MVP will play at some point in the series.""They`re damn good with him and they`re damn good without him,"" James said. ""No matter offensively or defensively. Listen they`ve had a two-time MVP sit out playoff games and they`ve won, all right. They`re good. They`re great, actually."""
2018/6/4,Parkland sheriff`s deputy who failed to confront shooter breaks his silence,"SUNRISE, Fla. -- The former sheriff`s deputy who has been widely criticized for his actions during a mass shooting that left 17 dead at a Florida high school is breaking his silence during a two-part interview on NBC`s ""Today Show."" The segment will air Tuesday morning.NBC says in a news release that anchor Savannah Guthrie asked Scot Peterson if he would acknowledge that ""he missed it"" by standing outside the building as a gunman fired an AR-15 assault-style rifle into classrooms. Peterson tells Guthrie he ""lives with that.""Peterson retired from the Broward Sheriff`s Office after surveillance video showed him outside the building where the shooting occurred. Peterson radioed the sheriff`s office with a warning.""Be advised we have possible -- could be firecrackers -- I think we have shots fired, possible shots fired,"" he said.Seconds later, he was seen running before he stopped to radio dispatch another time.""Make sure we get some units over here, I need to shut down Stoneman Douglas,"" Peterson said.But during the shooting, Peterson never entered the building.Broward Sheriff Scott Israel condemned Peterson`s actions, saying he should have gone inside.Last month, the father of Meadow Pollack, a student killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, filed a lawsuit accusing several people of enabling the killer. But he also placed blame at Peterson. In the lawsuit, Andrew Pollack`s lawyers say Peterson, who was armed, failed to confront the threat.""Scot Peterson is a coward,"" the lawsuit says.During the interview with NBC, Peterson calls the students ""my kids"" and says that knowing what he now knows, he would have ""been in that building in a heartbeat."""

CBS affiliate WGCL reports 25-year-old Morgan Summerlin was sentenced to 30 years, 20 of which will be served in prison and the balance on probation. Summerlin admitted allowing Richard Office and Alfredo Trejo to rape and abuse the girls when they were 5 and 6, the station reports. They are now 6 and 7.Her defense attorney argued that Summerlin herself had been sexually abused as a child.

They said afterward, he gave the girls $100, which their mother immediately took from them. A prosecutor said the girls were told to call him ""`Pop"" and that he gave drugs to Summerlin, reported TV station WXIA.Summerlin pleaded guilty early last month to first-degree cruelty to children, trafficking a person for sexual servitude and enticing a child for indecent purposes. Trejo was convicted of convicted of rape, sexual battery, child molestation and aggravated child molestation and sentenced to serve 25 years in prison and life on probation.A jury found Office guilty of rape, trafficking a person for sexual servitude, sexual battery, and child molestation. A judge sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus 146 additional years."

While Americans have largely seen lackluster wage growth during the past year, the roughly 500 associates laboring at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy just drew a large bump in pay, putting the law firm at the top of the legal heap in terms of salaries paid to attorneys just starting out.A spokesperson for the 690-lawyer firm confirmed that it is hiking associate salaries by $10,000 to $15,000, bringing a first-year associate`s salary to $190,000. A second-year associate at the firm will now make $200,000, while an eight-year associate will pull in $330,000.The prior high mark had been set two years ago by Cravath, Swaine & Moore, which upped starting pay by $20,000 to $180,000, an industry standard that was quickly matched by Milbank and multiple other firms.""Two years have now gone by, and there is cost-of-living increases and inflation,"" Scott Edelman, chairman of Milbank, said in an interview with the American Lawyer. The firm wanted to ""set fair, market-leading compensation,"" he added.The pay hike at one of New York`s most prestigious litigators would not have a ""material impact"" on its finances, Edelman noted, telling the industry publication: ""if we didn`t do this at some point"" another firm would.The law firm`s gross revenue increased 7.1 percent to $916.5 million in 2016, according to the American Lawyer."

2018/6/5,How statements on Trump Tower meeting have changed,"For months, President Donald Trump`s legal team, the White House press secretary and others in Trump`s orbit said he did not dictate or help draft a June 2017 statement trying to explain the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his eldest son and a Russian lawyer.Turns out, that wasn`t true.In a January letter to special counsel Robert Mueller, Mr. Trump`s lawyers said the president ""dictated a short but accurate response"" to the first report that his son, Donald Trump Jr., and others had met with the Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election. The New York Times revealed the existence of the letter on Saturday.The Trump Tower meeting ‰ÛÓ and the White House`s initial response to the first reports of the meeting ‰ÛÓ has been a key moment in Mueller`s investigation into whether anyone on the campaign colluded with Russia and whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. The lawyers` statement is buried near the end of the 20-page memo, which asserts that Mr. Trump cannot be forced to testify and argues that he could not have legally committed obstruction of justice.In the initial written statement from Trump Jr. on June 8, 2017, he said the Trump Tower gathering was a ""short introductory meeting"" focused on a disbanded program that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended the adoptions in response to Magnitsky Act sanctions created in response to alleged human rights violations in Russia.While the Magnitsky Act was discussed, it was later revealed that the meeting was held on the promise of damaging information about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. did not mention the promise of dirt on Clinton until a statement the next day.Trump Jr. later told Senate investigators in September 2017 that he had agreed to a meeting with attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton because he wanted to determine her ""fitness"" for office.A look at the evolving explanations from the administration on how the statement was drafted:JULY 16, 2017: In one of a series of interviews in June, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said on NBC`s ""Meet The Press"" that ""the president was not, did not, draft the response. The response came from Donald Trump Jr. and, I`m sure, in consultation with his lawyer.""He added: ""The president was not involved in the drafting of the statement and did not issue the statement. It came from Donald Trump Jr. So that`s what I can tell you because that`s what we know.""JULY 31, 2017: In response to a Washington Post report that Trump had dictated the statement, Sekulow issued a statement: ""Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent.""AUGUST 1, 2017: White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump ""certainly didn`t dictate, but he ‰ÛÓ like I said, he weighed in, offered suggestion like any father would do."" Sanders argued there was ""no inaccuracy"" in the statement.SEPTEMBER 7, 2017: In a closed-door interview with Senate Judiciary Committee staff, Trump Jr. was asked by investigators whether his father was involved in drafting the statement. He said he didn`t know, and that he had never spoken to his father about it. Asked again, Trump Jr. said his father ""may have commented through Hope Hicks,"" who was Trump`s longtime aide.Investigators then asked if Trump Jr. knew if any of Trump`s comments were incorporated into the final statement.""I believe some may have been, but this was an effort through lots of people, mostly counsel,"" Trump Jr. responded.Trump Jr. said he was asked if he wanted to speak to his father as the statement was drafted, but he said he ""chose not to because I didn`t want to bring him into something that he had nothing to do with.""JANUARY 29, 2018: In the letter to Mueller, Trump`s then-lawyers wrote: ""You have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump, Jr. His son then followed up by making a full public disclosure regarding the meeting, including his public testimony that there was nothing to the meeting and certainly no evidence of collusion.""JUNE 4, 2018: Asked about the discrepancies on Monday, Sanders repeatedly declined to answer and referred reporters to Trump`s personal lawyers.""This is from a letter from the outside counsel and I direct you to them to answer that question,"" she said.In an evening appearance on CNN, one of the president`s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, said Sanders and the others had made a mistake and rejected the idea it was a lie.""I have no idea how they got it wrong, but they got it wrong,"" he said, dismissing the significance of the controversy. ""It was a mistake. I swear to God it was a mistake."""

2018/6/6,Man who plotted Christmas Day attack on San Francisco pier pleads guilty,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A man who told undercover agents that he wanted to carry out a Christmas Day bombing and shooting attack at a popular San Francisco tourist attraction will receive a 15-year sentence after pleading guilty Monday in a federal case. Everitt Aaron Jameson, 26, admitted under a plea deal that he attempted to aid a terrorist organization after he planned the attack during talks with undercover FBI agents, including one he thought was with the Islamic State group.Jameson, a former tow-truck driver from Modesto, told undercover federal agents that he planned to use pipe bombs to channel victims into part of Pier 39 so he could shoot them.Prosecutors are dropping a second charge of distributing bomb-making information under the plea agreement.He told the undercover agents how to build pipe bombs and where he intended to assemble the bombs, and he asked them for remote timers, according to court documents.Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and Jameson didn`t want to take the chance of receiving a 40-year sentence, defense attorney Charles Lee said.CBS San FranciscoLee said his client was having second thoughts and didn`t actually take steps to carry out the plot. Investigators found no bomb-making materials, and three firearms found during a search were legally owned by his stepfather and were locked in a gun case where Jameson couldn`t to get them, Lee said.An undercover agent told Jameson several times to think about what he was doing, according to the FBI, and each time Jameson said he was ready to attack. Agents also recovered a martyr`s letter signed with an Islamic variation of Jameson`s name.Jameson was discharged from the Marines for having an allergic reaction to a bee sting, had a ""tumultuous marriage"" in which his wife went to prison for attacking him with a knife, and he lost parental rights to his two children two days before he first talked to agents, Lee said.""Every time the government`s been involved in his life, it`s turned out poorly for him,"" Lee said. ""I do believe he was very susceptible to suggestion.""The FBI arrested Jameson on Dec. 22. He is set for sentencing Sept. 4."
2018/6/6,Mississippi court hears case on Cambridge Analytica,"A case involving the British data firm Cambridge Analytica is before a county judge in Mississippi, where representatives of a British insurance company and the University of Mississippi have testified under oath that no private data of British citizens was ever transferred to the American university.Britain`s Fair Vote Project continues to seek proof that private data ended up in Mississippi, despite their repeated denials. The hearing continues Wednesday.Eldon Insurance Services Ltd. and its lawyers argue the lawsuit`s aim is to make the insurance seller appear guilty even though there`s no evidence of wrongdoing. They want Hinds County Chancery Judge Denise Owens to dismiss the suit as having no place in the Mississippi courts.""This is a lawsuit between British people and it`s about the alleged use of British people`s personal data,"" lawyer Sterling Kidd argued Tuesday in Jackson. ""This court does not have personal jurisdiction.""The Mississippi action stems from April testimony before the British Parliament by Brittany Kaiser, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica. Kaiser told Parliament she believes that leaders of the 2016 Brexit campaign to have the United Kingdom leave the European Union misused private data from Eldon Insurance and the U.K. Independence Party. She said Eldon owner Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore told multiple people they were going to use her proposals and create their own ""their own Cambridge Analytica"" at the University of Mississippi.Cambridge Analytica said it did no paid or unpaid work on the Brexit campaign. It also denies using Facebook data to support Donald Trump`s presidential campaign.Both Banks and Wigmore, until recently an Eldon director, were prominent proponents of the successful 2016 Brexit referendum on Britain leaving the European Union. John Banks, whom Kidd identified as Arron Banks` brother and Eldon`s general counsel, attended Tuesday and consulted with Kidd during the hearing.The entity in question is an Eldon subsidiary, Big Data Dolphins Ltd., which the company says aims to use data for the legitimate purpose of improving insurance sales.Dorsey Carson, arguing on behalf of Fair Vote Project and its leader Kyle Taylor, said plenty of evidence supports the lawsuit being heard in Mississippi, including a lease that Eldon signed with the university in February. The organization says any transfer of data to the United States would have broken British law, and wants to prove that Cambridge Analytica, Banks and Wigmore acted illegally to manipulate the outcome of the Brexit referendum.""The question has to be asked: Why do they not want a court order prohibiting them from destroying evidence using personal data that neither Mr. Kyle Taylor or anyone else gave them permission to use?"" Carson told the judge.It was Mississippi`s Republican Gov. Phil Bryant who ultimately connected Eldon with the university after cultivating relationships with Banks, pro-Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage and others.The lease, filed publicly for the first time Tuesday, shows the state economic development agency controlled by Bryant agreed to give Eldon and the university $100,000 to help complete office space for Big Data Dolphins.Josh Gladden, the university`s vice chancellor for research, testified that the office space has never been finished or occupied, and that Big Data Dolphins has no access to university computer servers and has stored nothing at the university. He said university researchers never agreed what specific projects they would assist Eldon with, and testified that Eldon hasn`t asked the university to destroy evidence.""The result of this investigation is, to our satisfaction, that there`s been no data transfer between any of the companies and the University of Mississippi,"" Gladden said.Victoria Sena, who manages the Big Data Dolphins project, testified she never discussed server access.""I haven`t transferred data,"" Sena testified. ""I don`t have access to data. There is no way to access it. There is no one to transfer it to.""Sena also said Eldon had no access to any improper trove of Facebook data, instead using input only from its own Facebook page. She said Eldon never ""scraped"" Facebook profiles for data, saying that`s illegal in the United Kingdom and would result in the company being banned from Facebook.

2018/6/7,Steel workers ask Trump to halt metal tariffs,"Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by the Trump administration have workers in mills that use those raw materials to build other products concerned about the future of their jobs.What`s happening?At the Borusan Mannesmann mill in Baytown, Texas, which manufactures steel pipe and tube products, workers penned letters to President Donald Trump on Tuesday, imploring the administration not to carry out the tariffs on steel and aluminum.""We need this company to grow even more,"" Roger Jaime, a worker at the mill, told KHOU`s Levi Ismail, as he and other workers wrote postcards to the White House and to other lawmakers to ask for relief.Why does it matter?The workers are concerned that the tariffs will harm the company and potentially result in job losses. The threat has already waylaid Boursan Mannesmann`s growth plans.Just over 200 people work at the mill, which imports raw material from a facility in Turkey. But it could have more employees because the company has been planning a $75 million expansion that would have added 170 jobs. That investment has been put on hold in the wake of the steel tariffs, given that the cost of getting materials from abroad will increase and selling the more expensive finished products will likely get tougher.Borusan Mannesmann administrators said the tariffs could create an added annual expense of more than $25 million for the relatively new company. Each employee`s letter asks Washington to ""please consider our situation"" -- for more time to build and create the chance for the jobs Baytown needs.What could the effects be?Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. can help local producers of the metals by making foreign products more expensive. But they can also increase costs more broadly for U.S. manufacturers that cannot source all their needs locally and have to import the materials. That hurts those companies and can lead to higher consumer prices, economists say.Steel and aluminum production jobs represent a small segment of the U.S. economy -- about 255,000 in steel and 61,000 in aluminum, according to Moody`s Investors Service.Manufacturers and end users make up a much larger portion of the economy. That means tariffs on raw materials, combined with retaliation from upset trading partners, may end up causing more harm than good. An estimate from consulting firm Trade Partnership forecast about 179,000 U.S. jobs lost versus 33,000 created as a result of the metal tariffs.BMP, the parent company that owns the mill in Baytown, has filed an exclusion request with the U.S. government asking for an two-year exemption on raw material imports produced at its facility in Turkey -- which would otherwise be subject to a 25 percent tariff. The company argues in its request that the exclusion is necessary for its expansion and would ""unlock"" the investment the firm needs.One of the projects Borusan Mannesman is contracted to supply is the GCX Pipeline, a roughly $1.8 billion, 514-mile project intended to transport natural gas from Texas` Permian basin to the Gulf Coast. The pipeline`s owner, Kinder Morgan, also filed an exclusion request, specifically for the specialized X70 pipe. The company argues the materials cannot be obtained from U.S. suppliers in time to meet the project`s October 2019 deadline.Kinder Morgan (KMI) said the project ""will directly support 2,500 well paying construction jobs during the eighteen months"" required to complete it and that ""steel pipe imports from Turkey are consistent with U.S. national security.""--CBS News` Jillian Harding and Rachel Layne contributed to this report"
2018/6/7,Tony Awards 2018: Sara Bareilles and Josh Groban on having each other`s backs as co-hosts,"This Sunday the 72nd annual Tony Awards will be hosted by singer-songwriters Sara Bareilles and Josh Groban. Bareilles starred in ""Waitress"" on Broadway and was nominated for a Tony for its score in 2016, and Groban earned a Tony nomination last year for his role in ""Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812.""Details of the award show`s opening number, which have been mostly kept under wraps, are rumored to be tailored to the unique talents of Bareilles and Groban, who would only joke when asked by ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King for clues about what they were planning.""It`s just going to be a lot of standing around awkwardly,"" Groban joked. Added Bareilles, ""I can do a clown horn.""Bareilles, who is nominated again this year for a song she wrote for the musical ""SpongeBob SquarePants,"" said yes to hosting in part because of Groban`s participation.""We`ve known each other for a long time and we have such a nice natural chemistry, and so it felt like this wonderful opportunity to do something that was scary but also to do it with a buddy,"" Bareilles said.""It`s nice to take risks with a friend. We both were a little nervous. This is new territory for both of us,"" Groban added. ""We knew we`d have each other`s backs.""Broadway crowds broke records this season with nearly 14 million total attendees. There are 34 first-time Tony nominees this year.""Writing a musical is by far and large the hardest thing I`ve ever done in my entire life. It was so much harder than I thought it was going to be, which made it all the more sweet to be acknowledged,"" Bareilles said of receiving her first nomination.Groban hopes the awards show will reach some of the younger fans of the stage, much like it did for him as a kid.""We both remember, you know, watching the Tonys when we were little, sitting on the floor and just saying ‰ÛÒ letting the Tony Awards be kind of the inspirer for us,"" Groban said. ""I think it`s not lost on us how many young people are going to be watching and how many young people are hopefully saying the same thing: I want to be in those shoes one day.""You can watch the Tony Awards on June 10 at 8:00 p.m. ET / 7:00 p.m. CT on CBS."

2018/6/7,U.S. pulls more staff from China over mysterious health issues,"GUANGZHOU, China -- A U.S. medical team was screening more Americans who work in a southern Chinese city as the State Department confirmed evacuating a number of government workers who experienced unexplained health issues like those that have hurt U.S. personnel in Cuba and China. The evacuations of the workers in Guangzhou followed medical testing that revealed they might have been affected.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said ""a number of individuals"" have been brought to the U.S. but didn`t say how many were affected or evacuated. One case in Guangzhou had been disclosed last month.That employee has been left with mild traumatic brain injury, and was sent home in April, U.S. officials told CBS News last month. The U.S. embassy and consulates in China have held town hall meetings to give employees a chance to ask questions.Nauert said tests are being offered to ""any personnel who have noted concerning symptoms or wanted baseline screening.""The mother of a State Department office who says he was injured in Guangzhou, China, tells CBS News` Steve Dorsey her son Mark Lenzi left country Tuesday ""on orders."" He was wrapping up a two-year tour there with his wife and two children.Security guards outside the consulate checked reporter`s IDs on Thursday and told them to leave the area and not attempt to talk to consulate staff.Asked about the latest incidents, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the U.S. had not formally raised the matter with Beijing.""If the U.S. makes formal contact with us, China will continue necessary investigations in an earnest and responsible manner and maintain close communication and cooperation with the U.S.,"" Hua said at a regularly scheduled news conference.China had earlier said it had no information about the cause of the symptoms.The New York Times identified the latest American employee evacuated as Mark A. Lenzi, a security engineering officer who left Wednesday night with his wife and two children.Lenzi told the Times he resided in the same apartment tower as the officer evacuated in April and suffered in recent months from what he called ""neurological symptoms.""Lenzi`s apartment was in one of several high-rise buildings in The Canton Place featuring restaurants and galleries spaced around a central plaza. Another diplomat who reported symptoms was at a different upscale building near the consulate.A U.S. official, who wasn`t authorized to discuss the situation publicly and requested anonymity, said the evacuated Americans are being brought for testing to the University of Pennsylvania. That`s where doctors have been treating and studying patients evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Havana.The China incidents have raised fears the unexplained issues that started in Cuba in 2016 have expanded. The U.S. government has deemed those incidents ""specific attacks"" on American workers but hasn`t publicly identified a cause or culprit. Most of the incidents were accompanied by bizarre, unexplained sounds that initially led U.S. investigators to suspect a sonic attack.The preliminary findings of the medical reports on the 24 U.S. Embassy personnel affected in Cuba showed they had sensory and memory problems similar to the brain dysfunction seen with concussions.The Penn team said the patients experienced persistent disability though rehabilitation therapy customized for them seemed to help.Canada in April also ordered families of diplomatic staff in Cuba to return home after mysterious health symptoms were detected in 10 Canadians stationed on the island.Canada said the 10 continued to show unexplained brain symptoms and that ""medical information raised concerns for a new type of a possible acquired brain injury.""Symptoms included dizziness, headaches and an inability to concentrate.The American government worker who was removed from China earlier reported ""subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.""In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China had ""said all the right things and have demonstrated their willingness to help us identify the vector which led to this medical incident.""The China incidents affect one of the most important of the seven U.S. diplomatic outposts in the country. The Guangzhou consulate opened months after the establishment of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Washington in 1979 and moved to its new purpose-built facility in 2013.It serves four southern provinces with a combined population of more than 204 million and processes more than 1 million visa applications of all types annually. It is also the only U.S. diplomatic installation in China authorized to process immigrant visas and handle adoptions."
2018/6/8,Challenges faced by children coming into the United States as asylum seekers,
2018/6/8,"Mexico still isn`t going to pay ""for that f*****g wall,"" former Mexican president says","Former Mexican President Vicente Fox ""absolutely"" stands by what he famously said a couple of years back-- that Mexico is not going to pay ""for that f*****g wall"" that President Trump frequently touts as the solution to illegal immigration. Fox`s indignation about footing the bill for the wall emanates from Mr. Trump`s equally frequent claims that that Mexico will pay for it.He was asked by CBS News` Major Garrett on ""The Takeout"" podcast whether his sentiment about the wall still stands.""Absolutely, yes, because it had to be expressed,"" Fox said, explaining that it`s a feeling ""when you`re offended, when your dignity is pisoteada (trampled), when all Mexicans have been offended that way, but more so because it`s not the answer to the problem of migration.""Fox originally sounded off on Mr. Trump`s wall proposal during an interview with Fusion`s Jorge Ramos in February 2016.""I`m not gonna pay for that f*****g wall. He should pay for it. He`s got the money,"" Fox said in the interview, referring to Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, responded to Fox during a debate in Texas by declaring, ""The wall just got 10 feet taller.""Not surprisingly, Fox thinks that Mr. Trump is ""absolutely wrong"" in his approach to combating illegal immigration, and he mourns the death of civility within previous administrations and Congress` bipartisan efforts -- if unsuccessful -- on the matter.""You have to use your reason. You have to use your intelligence, and there, seek the answers to the problem of migration,"" Fox told Garrett. The solution, he continued, is ""not investing $35 billion U.S. dollars that you taxpayers in the United States will have to pay for because, of course, Mexicans will not pay for that wall,"" Fox told Garrett.Mr. Trump`s call for the wall began as a campaign promise and has remained a rallying cry throughout his time in office.""We`ve got $1.6 billion dollars‰ÛÓ we`ve already started the wall on the southern border. The wall is started, $1.6 billion. So important,"" Mr. Trump said at the White House Wednesday prior to signing a bill expanding military veterans` access to health care.In March, Mr. Trump inspected eight border wall prototypes in California.Fox also said that Mr. Trump is ""just cheating people"" with his promises to bring jobs back to the United States, particularly within the coal industry, which he refers to as ""carbon.""""The idea of bringing jobs back to communities as Trump promised, in the case of the carbon industry, is false,"" Fox said. ""He`s just cheating people. He`s just falsely proposing that he will bring back those jobs, when he`s going to hurt nature and the environment severely.""For more of Major`s conversation with Vicente Fox, download ""The Takeout"" podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, or Spotify.

2018/6/9,World Oceans Day: 8 things you can do to make a difference,"The barrage of threats facing our oceans today might seem like an overwhelming tsunami of problems. Plastics are harming marine life. Carbon pollution is warming the oceans and increasing their acidity. Waters are being overfished.But there`s hope, according to experts and activists, who say there are a slew of steps you can take to help make a difference.""Things are bad but we`re at a state where we can definitely make a change,"" said Samantha Mackiewicz, director of World Oceans Day.World Oceans Day takes place every year on June 8 to celebrate Earth`s waters and highlight the challenges they face. This year, the focus is on plastic pollution, which is permeating our oceans.""What we`re asking people to do this year is to eliminate or reduce their use of single-use plastics ‰ÛÓ so that`s bags, bottles, straws ‰ÛÓ in honor of World Oceans Day,"" said Mackiewicz.""The hope is that if someone can take that action for one day, hopefully they could carry that behavior over beyond World Oceans Day and into the rest of the year,"" she said.Here`s a look at how you can curb your plastic use ‰ÛÓ and other actions experts suggest ‰ÛÓ to have a positive impact on our oceans` health as we mark World Oceans Day.Bring a garment bag to your dry cleaner""Invest in a zippered fabric bag and request that your cleaned items be returned in it instead of sheathed in plastic,"" says the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York City-based non-profit organization.There are likely dozens of other ways you could cut down on single-use plastics, which are things like Ziploc bags, disposable coffee-cup lids and plastic wrap. Try using your own on-the-go mug when you hit up a coffee shop, carrying a reusable water bottle at all times, including while traveling, and bringing your own utensils to work to avoid relying on plastic cutlery.Experts and activists also suggest using cloth bags instead of disposable ones for groceries, buying in bulk to cut back on packaging, and boycotting products with microbeads, which are tiny orbs of plastic that can be found in products like facial scrubs and toothpaste. They slip through water treatment plants and can be eaten by marine animals.All of those small steps could have a cumulative effect of cutting down on the colossal amounts of plastic that are ending up in our oceans. Just days ago, nearly 20 pounds of plastic bags and other plastic trash were pulled from the stomach of a pilot whale that died in Thailand, according to officials.One study has found that tossed plastic trash could outweigh fish by 2050 if we don`t make changes.Plastic breaks down over time and turns into little pieces that don`t go away ""but become almost part of the food chain,"" said Whitley Saumweber, an ocean policy consultant in Washington, D.C.""These small pieces of plastic are everywhere in the ocean and are being consumed by everything from the smallest plankton all the way up to whales,"" he said.Now, talk about it""Talk to your friends and family about why the ocean is important and why you take steps to help it, and challenge them to do the same,"" said Mackiewicz, the director of World Oceans Day.Others suggest carrying that conversation into public places.""If you`re at a restaurant and you ask not to have a plastic straw, then they`re going to start thinking, `Hmm, that`s interesting. I wonder why they did that,`"" said Kallan Benson, a 14-year-old oceans activist from Maryland who won the National Aquarium`s Promise for the Planet award this year.Benson said the extent to which plastics have permeated our lives and penetrated our environment is ""scary.""""As a youth, I know that someday this environment is going to be my responsibility and I`m going to be getting it with all these problems already,"" she said. ""How am I going to clean that up? How are we going to create a livable future for the rest of the generations on this planet?""Plan a cleanupMackiewicz said a good way to make a difference is to organize a garbage cleanup now. Whether it`s an inland cleanup or one near the coast, plan one in your community, she said.""No matter how far you live from the ocean, the ocean impacts you,"" she said. ""Everything leads to the ocean, every river. ... So, no matter if you`re cleaning inland or on the shore, you`re helping the ocean overall.""""Dine discriminately"" and ""buy American""One of the biggest issues related to human impact on the oceans is overfishing, said Saumweber. ""We`ve also got a real problem with illegal fishing,"" he said.Such practices have left many marine species severely depleted, with some on the brink of extinction, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).""The simplest thing to do is buy sustainability,"" said Saumweber.And that doesn`t only apply when at the grocery store. ""Dine discriminately,"" said Sarah Chasis, senior attorney and director of NRDC`s Oceans program.They recommend using the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch guide, which provides information to help consumers make choices that have less impact the environment.Saumweber said a key thing to do when looking to support sustainability ""is just buy American.""""We`ve got the best-managed fisheries in the world here in the States,"" he said. ""By and large, if you`re buying an American fish product, you`re buying a well-managed fishery.""Another component of this is to fish responsibly, said experts. That includes making sure you know the local rules, having a proper fishing license, and practicing catch and release.""We are at risk of depleting our ocean fisheries worldwide and so care has to be given in how we use those resources,"" said Chasis.Ditch your carOpting for public transportation over driving your car can impact your microclimate, said Lisa Emelia Svensson, director for Ocean at U.N. Environment, the environmental agency of the United Nations.An action like this can reduce your carbon footprint, and multiplied by the efforts of millions of others around the world, that may help slow global warming and ocean acidification ‰ÛÓ a change in ocean chemistry which threatens marine life.Bill Mook, who works in the oyster industry, says he has felt the impacts of acidity firsthand. He said his wake-up call came in 2009 when his oyster farm started having trouble producing oysters.The challenge was growing oyster larvae, which mature into oysters that we can eventually eat. They are very sensitive to changes in the acidity level of the water.""We realized that we were having a pH problem, an acidification problem, and started buffering our water, which is the equivalent of putting Tums in the water, essentially,"" said Mook, who is a Maine-based leader of the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition and owner of Mook Sea Farm.""What was surprising was that when we started doing that, it was literally like turning a light switch on and off ‰ÛÓ or on, I should say. And all of a sudden, each of the larval cohorts returned to their normal biology,"" he said.While that basically solved the problem for his oyster farm, the major global challenge of ocean acidification remains.""In the past 200 years alone, ocean water has become 30 percent more acidic ‰ÛÓ faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in the last 50 million years,"" says the Smithsonian Institution`s Ocean Portal, which is part of its Ocean Initiative.The oceans soak up about a quarter of the carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels, which changes their fundamental chemistry.Aside from walking, biking or the taking the bus instead of driving, experts and activists say you can also cut your daily emissions by finding ways to conserve energy.""Energy conservation is a huge, huge benefit to people,"" said Mook. ""And I can show you in my own business how over the years we have adopted technology that has dramatically allowed us to produce more and more oyster seed, for example, in our hatchery with less energy input, and I think that applies to small businesses all over the country, as well as to homes.""Send a message to Congress ‰ÛÓ or start localActivists and experts stress the importance of communicating with decision-makers.Individuals can have an impact on the health of our oceans by supporting policies that reduce carbon emissions, said Saumweber, who served as associate director for ocean and coastal policy in the White House Council on Environmental Quality in the Obama administration. He urged people to work to make sure their elected representatives support keeping high standards for fuel emissions, embrace alternative energy strategies and support subsidies for solar and wind power.There is also concern about ""threatened rollbacks to strong conservation laws that are on the books now,"" such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Magnuson‰ÛÒStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, said NRDC`s Chasis.The Trump administration has also proposed to open up huge areas of America`s coast to offshore oil and gas drilling.""We all saw what happened with the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and how damaging that was to coastal communities and fisheries and the health of the Gulf Coast ecosystem,"" said Chasis.She urged people to send a message to Congress and the Trump administration through a form on the NRDC`s website. ""This is a time for people to raise their voices,"" she said.Mackiewicz, with World Oceans Day, suggests starting local.Contacting local leaders ""is definitely the first step"" in impacting government policy, as well as seeing what you can change in your local communities, she added.Recycle, ""obviously""Experts say recycling is an obvious action to take.Check on what can be recycled in your community, and make sure you`re separating out your plastic ‰ÛÓ and that it`s eligible for recycling, said Chasis.""I know it sounds a little trite, like `reduce, reuse, recycle,` but it`s really true, and it`s something we`ve gotta change and we`ve gotta embrace,"" said Saumweber.While the U.S. is not the biggest driver of plastic pollution ‰ÛÓ China tops that list ‰ÛÓ ""it doesn`t mean we can`t lead by example and it`s not important for us as some of the world`s major consumers to make sure that we`re having an impact on the world through our actions,"" he said.""Think about it more""That`s what Kallan Benson, the 14-year-old oceans activist, would say to someone who asks what single action they could take to make a difference. The idea is that the more someone thinks about plastics and plastics pollution, the environment and the consequences of our actions, the more likely they are to act on it.""When we go to the grocery story, we`re more likely to bring our own bags instead of getting plastics bags. We`re more likely to go out and talk to our legislators about the Styrofoam ban just because we`re constantly thinking about it,"" she said.""Being more aware is the biggest thing you can do,"" she added."

She will be very much missed. pic.twitter.com/c5kVHs256Y ‰ÛÓ Eunice Gayson (@EuniceGayson) June 9, 2018In a 2012 interview with the Daily Record, Gayson explained that she helped Connery overcome nerves on the very first day of production when he kept bumbling his now-iconic opening line. Taking him to lunch and pretending to imbibe herself, she encouraged him to go off the wagon and loosen up with a drink. He downed two.""Well, not having had a drink for so long, it really affected him, but in a nice sort of way ‰ÛÒ all his nerves seemed to go out the window,"" she said. ""We went back on set and he said the name `Bond, James Bond` in a beautiful way.""As originally planned, the character of Trench was to have returned in subsequent Bond adventures, but director Guy Hamilton dropped her from the third film, ""Goldfinger.""Gayson held a notable place in film history as the very first Bond Girl, though it wasn`t without its indignities. A striking presence, Gayson`s voice was nevertheless dubbed over by another actress in both films.SignumBorn in 1928 in Surrey, England, Gayson made stage appearances in ""Born Yesterday,"" ""No, No Nanette,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" and in British TV revues. Her first film appearance was in 1948`s ""My Brother Jonathan."" Her credits include ""To Have and To Hold,"" ""Miss Robin Hood,"" the Goon comedy ""Down Among the Z Men,"" ""Dance Little Lady,"" the historical drama ""Zarak,"" and two thrillers from director Terence Fisher: ""The Last Man to Hang"" and ""The Revenge of Frankenstein.""She also appeared on TV in ""The Saint"" (starring future Bond Roger Moore), ""The Avengers,"" and ""Secret Agent.""In the 1990s she returned to the stage to play Little Red Riding Hood`s grandmother in a London production of Stephen Sondheim`s ""Into the Woods.""In 2012 Gayson wrote her autobiography, ""The First Lady of Bond"" (Signum)."

2018/6/11,Spain to let in migrant rescue boat carrying hundreds,"ROME -- Spain stepped in as a safe refuge on Monday after Italy and Malta dug in for a second day and refused to let a rescue ship with 629 people aboard dock in their ports, leaving the migrants at sea as a diplomatic standoff escalated under Italy`s new anti-immigrant government. ""Enough!"" said Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini. ""Saving lives is a duty, but transforming Italy into an enormous refugee camp isn`t.""He tweeted: #Chiudiamoiporti. ""We`re closing the ports.""Maltese Premier Joseph Muscat also refused to take in the ""Aquarius"" ship of the humanitarian group SOS Mediterranee. He accused Italy, which coordinated the rescue, of violating international norms governing sea rescues.Spain`s government confirmed hours later that the Aquarius would be allowed to dock in the southeastern city of Valencia.Italy`s position, Muscat said, risks ""creating a dangerous situation for all those involved.""The mayors of Valencia and Barcelona in Spain offered their ports on Monday to receive the charity-run rescue ship, with Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau chastizing her European counterparts and saying the crisis ""puts in question"" the unity of the European Union. She said ""the duty of a democratic government is not to look away"" in a humanitarian crisis.Colau has also called on the new Spanish government, now led by the Socialist party, to change migration policies set by the previous conservative administration.As the rhetoric intensified earlier between Italy and Malta, the Aquarius remained on standby in the Mediterranean Sea with its 629 passengers, including 123 unaccompanied minors and seven pregnant women. The ship said it had been ordered by Italy`s coast guard coordination center late Sunday to remain 35 miles off Italy and 27 miles from Malta._ÙÓ« UPDATE The #Aquarius remains instructed to standby between #Italy and #Malta.

All passengers were offloaded to the Aquarius to be taken to land.Doctors Without Borders, which has staff aboard the Aquarius, tweeted a video of some of the women aboard the ship praying Monday morning and said they were unaware of the diplomatic drama being waged on land over their fate.""Thank you Lord,"" the women sang. The group said it ""urgently requests a swift resolution and a designated port of safety.""The standoff marked the first inevitable clash over migrant rescues with League leader Salvini, now running Italy`s interior ministry. Salvini campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform that also included a vow to expel hundreds of thousands of migrants already in Italy, even though experts doubt such mass deportations are feasible or financially viable.Malta, for its part, has consistently refused to take in migrants, citing its small size and limited capacities.The island nation has progressively reduced the number of migrants it has taken in over the past decade, from a high of 2,775 in 2008 to just 23 last year, according to U.N. statistics.Salvini pointed to Malta`s unwillingness in accusing Europe as a whole of leaving Italy on its own to deal with the refugee crisis. He noted that other European countries are very much involved in current rescue operations in the Mediterranean -- including a German aid group currently off Libya -- but no country is stepping up to actually take in the migrants. That was before Spain stepped up.""Italy has stopped bowing our heads and obeying,"" Salvini said in a Facebook post. ""This time we say no.""The standoff was actually the third in recent weeks, after the outgoing government of Premier Paolo Gentiloni refused to let humanitarian aid groups dock in Italian ports until the ships` flag nations had formally requested permission. Those incidents delayed the migrants` arrival, but they ultimately made it to Italy."
2018/6/11,"Analyst: Trump`s G-7 performance was ""geopolitical equivalent of the Comey firing""","President Trump`s break with American allies at the G-7 Summit was the worst foreign policy outing of his presidency, and the worst summit since they started back in 1975, according to Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the Eurasia Group. Bremmer called Mr. Trump`s performance ""the geopolitical equivalent of the Comey firing.""The tension between the president and America`s closest allies unfolded at the end of a weekend that looked promising, as Mr. Trump gave indications that he would sign onto the summit`s final declaration.But en route to his meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un, Mr. Trump angrily tweeted about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, accusing him of making ""false statements"" at a news conference, and declared that he was rescinding his agreement.Based on Justin‰Ûªs false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market! ‰ÛÓ Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2018German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the president`s reversal ""via tweet"" from signing onto the G-7 statement was ""sobering and a bit depressing.""The decision to break from the agreement drew criticism from lawmakers at home as well. Republican Senator John McCain tweeted: ""To our allies ...

He was forced to go, he didn`t want to attend the summit, his advisors all said, `You have to be there.` He shows up late, he leaves early, he cancels his direct meeting with [French President] Macron. The entire time he`s seething, bristling and petulant, but he`s on good behavior. Finally he leaves, and he says, `That`s it, I`m going to blow it up.`""""I`m sure that sending that [tweet] out against Trudeau, America`s closest ally, felt really good at the time,"" Bremmer said. But the result is, ""It really damages an important long-term relationship.""""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King asked, ""What did Trudeau say that was so egregious?""""Nothing that he hadn`t said already,"" Bremmer replied. ""Trudeau was careful not to insult the president personally. He did say that the Canadians were not going to just sit and take it, in terms of the American tariffs, that there would be retaliation. [That`s] exactly what he had said on `Meet the Press` the week before and in other public statements.""This was not about what Trudeau said. This is about Trump`s feelings. And when Trump feels a certain way, he is not to be told otherwise by his handlers. I think he showed very clearly, `You can`t tell me to do whatever you want ‰ÛÒ I`m my own man, I`m my own president.` And again, at the time it felt great, but this is pretty grave damage to the most important allies around the world.""Will the spat do lasting damage to the Western alliance?""They`re not going to form a G-6, they`re not unified, they have no ability to get together on other issues ‰ÛÒ the Europeans, the Japanese, the Canadians. No. But they don`t trust America,"" Bremmer said. ""Trump said that the relationship with the allies was a 10. Maybe out of 100?

What they may find a bit mysterious is why she`s decided to walk away. Tracy Smith has our Sunday Profile:She`s the forensic scientist with the neck tattoo. Actress Pauley Perrette`s goth-girl character Abby Sciuto on ""NCIS"" is one of the best-loved crimefighters on TV.But now, Perrette`s decided to leave the show ‰ÛÓ Perette bows out in an episode airing on Tuesday May 8 ‰ÛÓ and after 15 years, she`s having a tough time letting go.CBS""It makes me sad to imagine a world without Abby in it,"" she said. ""It really makes me sad.""""Did you go through that whole grieving process?"" Smith asked.""I`m still grieving. And it`s sad. I, like, usually cry in my car every single day when I drive to work. And I usually cry on my way home at some point. And then I take a deep breath, and I go, `All right,` you know?""As a character, Abby really is something of an institution -- a young female scientist who`s often the smartest person in the room. ""Abby made science cool and attainable for young women,"" Perrette said. ""And this television character did more than encourage it. It made it cool. It made it exciting. It made it fun.""She also looks fun, with her raven braids and body art. Of course, not much of it is real; Turns out Pauley Perrette is actually a natural blonde, so the black hair comes from a bottle. (""I end up with blonde roots!"" she said.)CBS NewsAnd the famous neck tattoo is a fake, carefully applied in the makeup trailer before every taping.Abby`s all fiction. But Perrette herself nearly became a crimefighter for real.Growing up in Alabama, young Pauley was fascinated by police work. She studied criminal science in college, and then moved to New York City to finish her master`s degree.Smith asked, ""So, you`re headed down this criminal science path, and bartending to put yourself through school? What happened?""""I had overheard a girl say she had made $3,000 shooting a commercial,"" Perrette said. ""And I was thinking, `Who has $3,000? Like, that`s insane. That`s crazy! $3,000! Who would have $3,000? That`s nuts.` So then Walter from coat check, the actor, had come up to me and said, `I know this director who`d love you.` So I found the guy`s name, walked into his office, and I went, `Hey. Walter from coat check said you`d love me.`""Did he ever: Before long, Perrette was doing commercials of her own, like this Sprint ad:She played a DJ opposite the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in 2000`s ""Almost Famous"":And three years later, she took her place in the ""NCIS"" lab, black bangs and all.She says she`s always loved the job, but not the spotlight that goes with it. So Perrette -- who`s now divorced -- spends a lot of her free time at her Hollywood home with her four-legged companions.CBS NewsSmith asked, ""What is it about the fame that bothers you?""""It`s being a commodity,"" Perrette said. ""It`s just very dehumanizing. I hope I`m not wrong, but I think that I have earned a little bit of time to myself. Just stay home. Go to church.""""What about a love life?""""Nope. Tried it. Not for me. Not at all.""""And you`ve been happier since you figured that out?""""Delighted,"" Perrette said.

""Hospitals, bathrooms, churches, please do not chase down your favorite celebrity at any of these places!""CBS NewsOf course that celebrity thing cuts both ways: Pauley Perrette has been able to speak out on a number of causes.

""I have a business manager that handles all of my money. Unlike any other client he has, I`m not allowed to have my money, because I`ll just give it away.""For instance, she`s created a scholarship for girls who want to follow in Abby`s footsteps: ""In honor of Abby, and in honor of young women that want to pursue science and math and forensics.""So, in that sense, Abby lives forever?

2018/6/12,"Latest crash tests reveal safety concerns for Ford Explorer, Jeep Grand Cherokee","Crash tests on two popular SUVs reveal serious safety concerns. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 2018 Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee ""poor"" ratings in front passenger crash tests, which show protections built into the driver`s side aren`t necessarily there for front seat passengers.The agency tested eight SUVs. Only three of them earned the top score of ""good"" ‰ÛÒ 2019 Kia Sorento, 2018 Volkswagen Atlas and 2018 GMC Acadia. Three others were rated ""acceptable"" ‰ÛÒ 2018 Toyota Highlander, 2018 Nissan Pathfinder and 2018 Honda Pilot.The crash test focused on front-end crashes where SUVs were going 40 mph. The Insurance Institute estimates 25 percent of serious injuries and fatalities from frontal crashes are the result of these types of accidents, reports CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave.The 2018 Ford Explorer rated poor because its structure collapsed ‰ÛÒ intruding as much as 15 inches into the SUV ‰ÛÒ resulting in a high likelihood of injuries to the front passenger`s right hip and left lower leg. Ford insisted the Explorer is safe, saying: ""We continually make improvements to our vehicles to help our customers stay safe on the road.""""We were observing that some of the counter measures or the design changes that automakers were making on the driver`s side weren`t necessarily making it to the right side of the vehicle,"" said David Zuby, the IIHS chief research officer.In the test, the passenger crash dummy`s head in the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee hits the dashboard through the airbag. The side airbag does not deploy and the door opens allowing the dummy`s head to go outside the SUV.Insurance Institute for Highway SafetyThe poor performance resulted in possible head injuries. The vehicle`s safety cage intruded into the cabin by up to 10 inches. Fiat-Chrysler, which makes the Jeep, said all its vehicles ""meet or exceed federal safety standards"" and ""are engineered to address real-world driving situations. No single test measures overall vehicle safety.""""My advice to people who are shopping for new vehicles is that they`ve got better choices,"" Zuby said.The 2019 Kia Sorento scored ""good"" after it was redesigned to better protect front passengers. It is the only SUV of the eight tested to earn the IIHS` highest overall rating: top safety pick plus.Both the Jeep and the Explorer are older designs. Ford expects its all-new 2020 Explorer to perform better when it`s launched next year. IIHS said it expects Jeep to improve its performance when the Grand Cherokee is updated."
2018/6/12,Why your budget will feel the Fed`s next rate hike,"The Federal Reserve is widely expected to again raise its key short-term interest rate this week as U.S. economic growth remains strong and unemployment is at an 18-year low. The bottom line for borrowers: Everything from credit cards to auto loans to mortgages is about to become more expensive.The Fed`s monetary policymakers are likely to add another quarter-point to the central bank`s key interest rate, putting it at 1.75 percent to 2 percent, the highest since 2008, economists said. This would be the second of as many as four interest rate hikes this year. The Fed last raised its benchmark rate a quarter-point in March, moving it into the range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.The most immediate affect for consumers will appear in the form of higher interest rates on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable rate mortgages, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. The average credit card now charges a record-high 17 percent, and that will climb further, he said.For borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages, the affects could be dramatic, he said. ""If your variable-rate mortgage only adjusts once a year, and there were three interest rate hikes in that year, borrowers should hang on because the monthly payment difference could be a doozy.""Rates on new mortgages and car loans will also go up, resulting in higher monthly payments, he said. Fixed rates have been on the rise, with the benchmark 30-year mortgage rate recently hitting a seven-year high of 4.8 percent during the week of May 23 before retreating.On the other hand, rates on interest-bearing instruments like savings and checking accounts will tick up, benefiting consumers who save.""While rising rates are good for savers, they can`t sit back and wait for improving returns to come to them,"" McBride said. ""Savers need to aggressively pursue the banks and credit unions with the best rates.""The best savings account rate is 2.05 percent, almost 23 times the national average of just 0.09 percent, according to Bankrate.com.The Fed`s latest rate actions are a result of its dual mandate: to keep inflation in check and to optimize employment. Unemployment has steadily declined, reaching 3.8 percent in May. U.S. economic growth is expected to be in the range of a robust 4.1 percent to 4.5 percent in the second quarter, according to notes by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and independent research firm Macroeconomic Advisers.The strong economy is causing an increase in demand for resources, a moderate rise in wages and nonlabor costs, heightening inflationary fears, said Kathy Bostjancic, an economist with Oxford Economics, in a research note. The Fed raises interest rates to cool down the economy and keep prices in check.""Market participants will scrutinize the policy statement and press conference for hints on whether the Fed leans toward three or four rate hikes this year,"" she said. ""We continue to believe it will be four.""The current inflation rate is 2.5 percent for the 12 months ended April 2018, according to the U.S. Labor Department. The Fed has an annual inflation target of about 2 percent, Bostjancic said. However, ""in the near-term, many policymakers anticipate inflation to overshoot the 2 percent target for a period of time,"" she said.The stock market has already factored in a rate increase and shouldn`t have a strong reaction if that is the Fed`s decision this week, according to a note by TD Securities. ""The market is extremely well priced for a June rate hike, and the Fed will not disappoint,"" the note said. TD Securities is expecting three rate increases in 2018.""The price of money is rising, and as it continues to rise it will buffet financial markets, leading to greater volatility. This is normal."" McBride said. ""Investors shouldn`t be taken aback and should stick with their current investment strategy."""
2018/6/13,6/12/18: Red and Blue,
2018/6/13,Why prescription drug shortages are so costly,"President Donald Trump`s proposed blueprint to lower prescription drug prices has prompted plenty of speculation about the reasons behind America`s outsized medicine costs. In all the analysis, however, one expensive and dangerous piece of the equation may be overlooked: chronic drug shortages.Massive shortages of vital medicines used in hospitals and other health care facilities have become routine throughout the U.S., jeopardizing patient health, comfort and safety and, ultimately, adding to already high health care costs.At last count, more than 200 drugs were on the shortage list compiled by the University of Utah`s Drug Information Service. The most significant shortages hit generic injectable medications such as epinephrine (adrenaline), morphine and bupivacaine, a common anesthetic used in childbirth. All these have been staples in hospitals for years, even decades.Basics such as sterile water, IV bags and saline are also in short supply. In fact, shortages have prevented 71 percent of practitioners from providing recommended drugs, according to a recent survey from the Institute for Safe Medication Practices.The most recent shortage crisis involves injectable opioids. A perfect storm of long-standing manufacturing problems and recent government restrictions on access to raw materials in response to the opioid abuse crisis has left many cancer, hospice and emergency room patients without efficient and effective pain relief treatment, Erin Fox, senior director of the University of Utah`s drug information and support services explained. Fox tracks drug shortages for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.Hurricane Maria and the damage it did to drug manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico put a spotlight on the shortage problem. For months after the hurricane, U.S. hospitals and other health care facilities scrambled to find alternatives to Puerto Rican-produced IV bags that hold saline solution and are used to dilute and administer medication. Damage from the storm also disrupted the distribution of an estimated 90 other medical products and medicines produced in Puerto Rico.But problems with shortages were already rampant before Hurricane Maria, said Fox. The real culprit is problems at mainland pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. ""Most of the time, the problem is some type of quality issue related to machinery or raw materials,"" explained Fox. ""It could be contaminated particles, bacteria, metal shavings, glass particles -- all kinds of things. There`s a real quality control problem.""The majority of injectable drugs and supplies are manufactured by the country`s largest pharmaceutical company, Pfizer. It`s responsible for the problems with Mylan`s EpiPen products, reported earlier this year, and the recent recall of two batches of naloxone, a drug used to treat opioid overdoses.Pfizer says shipments of EpiPen products are increasing and that the company doesn`t expect shortages of naloxone because it produces two alternative doses that were not recalled.Pfizer`s manufacturing capabilities jumped substantially after the drug giant acquired Hospira, the largest manufacturer of generic sterile injectable drugs. Problems plagued Hospira plants before the acquisition, and Pfizer has made some efforts to fix them. Progress is slow, however, and new problems seem to crop up continuously.And when complications hit, not a lot of alternatives are available because of Pfizer`s huge presence and the extreme consolidation in the drugmaking business, Fox explained.""We are working hard to minimize supply shortages in the future through major investments to modernize and bring these legacy Hospira plants up to Pfizer`s world-class manufacturing standards,"" Pfizer said in a statement, noting that it has invested $800 million in those sites and plans to inject at least another $1.3 billion. ""It is important to note that the manufacture of sterile injectable medicines is an incredibly complex undertaking that requires highly sophisticated manufacturing equipment and processes, highly trained colleagues and major financial investment.""Some experts worry that not enough attention is being paid to the production of generic injectables because profit margins are slim for these common and inexpensive drugs. ""These are generics that have been around 50 or 60 years and that everyone expects to have on hand,"" Fox said. ""These are products with low margins, yes, but the companies making them have good profits. They aren`t going out of business.""""You wouldn`t see this happening with expensive cancer drugs,"" said Diana Barnard, a palliative care physician at University of Vermont Health Network, who often prescribes opioids for her seriously ill and terminal patients. As if hearing her complaint, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement on May 31 acknowledging the drug shortage problem and outlining the agency`s plans for dealing with it. Those measures include increasing notification requirements for drugmakers so the FDA can anticipate supply problems before they hit the market.The FDA action is welcome, said Fox, but the quest for transparency will be challenging. ""Drug companies are notoriously secretive. They believe where and how a drug is manufactured is a trade secret,"" she explained.In the meantime, chronic drug shortages are most certainly adding to the sky-rocketing costs of pharmaceuticals and health care in general. While patient safety and comfort are the highest concern -- imagine, for instance, what happens when an EpiPen injector doesn`t work -- there`s no doubt the scramble hospitals, hospices and other health care facilities go through to find alternative drugs and therapies adds to overall costs, Fox said.She points to a study published earlier this year that shows generic drugs that experienced a shortage over the study period experienced a 55 percent price increase, compared to 44 percent for generics that didn`t undergo a shortage.In addition, a study Fox helped research back in 2011 found that personnel costs associated with managing drug shortages across U.S. hospitals added up to $216 million a year. This is time spent by physicians, pharmacists and nurses on tasks such as finding alternatives, managing dwindling inventory, informing staff and, often most onerous, adjusting facility-wide computer systems to accommodate the alternatives.These are all tasks that take health care professionals away from patient care. ""It`s extraordinarily costly to deal with these shortages even if you have a good alternative,"" Fox said.""It`s odd,"" she continued, ""the country that pays the most for drugs, pays for shortages. It just doesn`t make sense."""

Of the 60 people to become ill, the CDC had information on 47 cases, with 31, or 66 percent, involving hospitalization. No deaths have been reported.Caito Foods recalled the products shipped between April 17 and June 7. All had a ""best used by"" date of June 16.Salmonella infections can spread from a person`s intestines to their bloodstream, and in certain cases can be deadly unless treated quickly with antibiotics. Children under five and adults older than 65 are at higher risk.The outbreak has reportedly led to lawsuits in at least three states, including Michigan, the hardest hit with 32 cases. A food safety attorney representing a woman who became ill told the Detroit News the count of those stricken will likely rise.""While there are 60 so far, we expect that number to rise as time goes on and more become aware,"" Jory Lange Jr. told the newspaper. ""Past instances have shown for each reported case, there are 29 other cases that are unreported."""
2018/6/14,Signs a child is drowning can be easy to miss,"With summer recreation luring kids to the water, experts caution parents that one of the season`s favorite pastimes is also one of the most dangerous for children.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drowning is the second-leading cause of accidental deaths in kids under the age of 15. Children can drown in as little as an inch or two of water in a kiddie pool, bathtub, or even a cleaning bucket or cooler. But about half of cases involve swimming pools.What`s more, nearly half of child drownings happen within 25 yards of an adult, and 10 percent of adults will witness the situation without even realizing the drowning is happening.That`s because often times what most of us think of as the telltale signs of drowning ‰ÛÒ flailing arms and shouting for help ‰ÛÒ simply don`t happen, says Mario Vittone, a former U.S. Coast Guard officer, water safety expert and author of an article for Slate called ""Drowning Doesn`t Look Like Drowning.""He says there are two phases of drowning, the first being aquatic distress when people know they are in trouble and can wave or call for help. Then comes the instinctive drowning response.""That`s when you`re no longer capable to maintain your own airway and a lot of times the head will be back, the eyes will be glassed over and people will be looking toward safety or looking toward shore,"" Vittone told CBS News. ""[They will be] vertical in the water, very little or no supporting kick, mostly just arm movement and sort of a lateral splashing down of the water.""A drowning person`s head may bob up and below the surface of the water repeatedly or it can happen entirely under water.This instinctive drowning response lasts 30 to 60 seconds at the most, Vittone said, so it`s imperative the person gets help immediately.When it comes to supervision, especially for children, he said a lifeguard may not be enough.""Lifeguards have to focus and if you`ve ever tried to focus for a solid 15 minutes, it`s really tough to do,"" he said.If your child is not an extremely strong swimmer, Vittone recommends what`s called ""touch supervision.""""I`m close enough to them to reach them. You really can`t be sitting on the side of the pool with your non-swimming child and just be watching them. You certainly can`t have your cellphone out. You have to be paying attention to them and I like to tell parents to be close.""Teaching kids they should never go in the water without an adult is also an important part of overall water safety.""For every child that drowns, five are seriously injured. So just because you save them from drowning doesn`t mean you`re out of trouble,"" Vittone said. ""Those aquatic injuries can be very serious.""The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends all kids learn how to swim from certified swimming instructors. Adults should also teach children to stay away from pool drains and filters.Older kids and teens ‰ÛÓ even those who are proficient swimmers ‰ÛÓ should swim with a buddy.At pool parties or other group activities involving water, experts recommend having an adult designated ""water watcher"" at all times.""There`s always one parent who`s always watching the water, who`s not talking to anybody not socializing at the party doing nothing but watching the kids,"" Vittone said.This is an updated version of an article originally published on May 31, 2017."
2018/6/14,Key takeaways from Tuesday night`s primaries,"Tuesday night`s primaries in Virginia, South Carolina, Maine, Nevada and North Carolina continued some key trends in the 2018 midterm election cycle.It was generally a good night for some of the Republicans who stick with President Trump ‰ÛÓ and not so good for some of the others who have criticized him in the past. It was also a good night for women running on campaigns opposed to Mr. Trump, in a cycle that has more female candidates than ever before.Here are some key takeaways, and races, to remember as the election cycle continues apace.""We are the party of Donald J. Trump""In South Carolina, House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Mark Sanford, who has criticized Mr. Trump in the past, lost his primary to a vocal Trump supporter, hours after Mr. Trump blasted him on Twitter as ""very unhelpful"" and alluded to Sanford`s past affair in Argentina. State Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated Sanford, made it clear where she stands after declaring victory: ""We are the party of President Donald J.

2018/6/14,GOP brass shuns Nevada brothel owner Dennis Hof who won primary,"Nevada brothel owner Dennis Hof said the ""establishment got crushed"" when he knocked off an incumbent Republican in a state legislative primary. But now the flamboyant pimp who starred on the HBO adult reality series ""Cathouse,"" is being shunned by that some of that GOP establishment as he prepares to run for an Assembly seat in November.U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, considered the most vulnerable Republican up for re-election in the Senate this year, and Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the GOP`s gubernatorial nominee, are among those refusing to back Hof.Laxalt ""does not support Dennis Hof and will not be supporting him,"" Laxalt`s campaign manager Kristin Davison said in an email to AP. Incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, who is being forced out by term limits in November, and Wes Duncan, the GOP nominee for Laxalt`s job, also are turning their backs on Hof.But several high-profile conservatives didn`t shy away from endorsing the man who calls himself ""America`s Pimp"" in the GOP primary.""We need more successful, independent businessmen in the Nevada Legislature,"" said Michelle Fiore, a former GOP state legislator and big gun rights defender. ""I`m supporting Dennis Hof 1,000 percent.""Nevada GOP Chairman Michael McDonald stopped short of an endorsement but wrote a public letter attacking his primary opponent, Assemblyman James Oscarson, as a ""Never Trumper"" after he said Oscarson spread lies that Hof had endorsed Hillary Clinton.""We welcome fiscal conservatives such as Mr. Hof who want to join our party. We need more of them,"" McDonald wrote.Hof believes grassroots support will fuel his campaign and others will come around after he defeated Oscarson in a sprawling rural district in southern Nevada where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than a 3-to-1 margin.Hof said Wednesday that ""everybody just wants to focus on `brothels` and `pimps.`""""Guess what? The voters of District 36 didn`t care!"" he said in a statement.""They wanted someone to represent them who would keep their word,"" Hof said. He claimed voters liked that he was not in ""the pockets of the Carson City special interests,"" and wouldn`t raise their taxes. He said he would fight for their gun and water rights and supports President Donald Trump`s efforts ""to make America great again.""Eric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno, is among the longtime observers of Nevada elections who think Hof will win.""This is the classic `only-in-Nevada story`,"" Herzik told the AP. ""I don`t see that district flipping parties. You`re going to have some disgruntled Republicans, but they are sure not going to vote Democratic.""Former Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman won numerous elections despite being identified ""basically as a mob lawyer,"" Herzik said. He said Hof`s campaign may be a ""bad case of optics in a traditional sense. But that doesn`t seem to be that relevant in Nevada.""Hof spent $234,121 on the primary thanks largely to the $200,000 he loaned to his campaign. His Democratic opponent, Lesia Romanov, raised only $1,405, including $1,000 from the Nevada state teacher`s union.""At this point, most people are a little surprised that he won,"" she told the AP on Wednesday.

2018/6/15,"Drake stages ""Degrassi"" reunion with old cast mates for ""I`m Upset"" music video","In a past life, before he was a famous rapper, Drake was Jimmy Brooks on ""Degrassi: The Next Generation."" From 2001 to 2009 Drake, then known as Aubrey Graham, played a high school basketball star who was paralyzed when he was shot in the back by a classmate.The popular, long-running Canadian TV franchise chronicled the lives of teens at the fictional Degrassi high school and junior high. The show ended in 2015, but like many high school friendships, strong bonds still remain. And there`s always a time to catch up at reunions.Drake staged a ""Degrassi"" class of 2007 high school reunion with his former ""classmates"" recently. The rapper invited several old cast mates including Dalmar Abuzeid (Danny Van Zandt), Sarah Barrable-Tishaur (Liberty Van Zant), Nina Dobrev (Mia Jones), Stacey Farber (Ellie Nash), Jake Goldsbie (Toby Isaacs), Shane Kipple (Spinner Mason) and many others for the special event.And it wasn`t just the usual get-together of old friends -- it was also a music video shoot for Drake`s new song, ""I`m Upset."" The star announced the music video drop on Instagram around midnight ET Thursday.VIDEO LINK IN BIO A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Jun 13, 2018 at 8:26pm PDTThe video is filled with references to ""Degrassi,"" with Drake first buying a suit and getting ready to attend the reunion, then walking into Degrassi high school with Shane Kipple, who played his on-screen best friend, Spinner Mason. Once inside the reunion, we see a cast of characters acting just like their high school selves.Drake -- who played Jimmy Brooks -- even gets revenge on the boy who shot him, Rick. Jimmy`s new adult friends are seen chasing Rick down the school`s hallway to get payback for what he did when he was a teen.Even teachers were invited to the reunion. Stefan Brogen, who played teacher Archie ""Snake"" Simpson, appears in a scene with actors Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, who starred in the four-part ""Degrassi Goes Hollywood"" film special.Several of the actors also ""geeked out"" about reuniting with their old cast mates for a Drake music video.Lauren Collins, who played Paige Michalchuk on the show, posted a photo with Adam Ruggiero, who played Marco Del Rossi. ""The moment @adamoaruggiero and I wrapped our first (and safe to say only) rap video at 5am, scarfing Pizza Pizza in my old dressing room. We`ve been through a helluva lot together. This tops it all,"" Collins erote.Several other stars posted photos from the music video shoot seen below (or at these links)Like a real high school reunion, fans got a small glimpse into the class of 2007`s current lives. In an Instagram photo from the shoot, Nina Dobrev referenced her character, Mia Jones, who was a teen mom in the show. ""Remember when Mia had a kid? Mama got a baby sitter tonight,"" Dobrev wrote.During the final moments of the video, Drake properly throws it back with side-by-side images of each cast mate`s appearance in the show and their appearance in the music video. He added an extra dose of nostalgia by playing the old Degrassi theme song over the credits.Drake blended his rapping with his acting, and the video attracted fans of both his music and the teen drama. The nostalgic ""I`m Upset"" and ""Degrassi"" crossover made for an epic ""throwback Thursday,"" and received more than 2 million views on YouTube within the first day."

2018/6/15,"Natalie Portman documentary ""Eating Animals"" explores rise of so-called factory farming","Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman has graced the silver screen for the majority of her life, entertaining audiences at the age of 12 in her first film ""LÌ©on: The Professional"" and continuing to make her mark on Hollywood through ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,"" ""Black Swan"" and ""Jackie."" Portman is also a longtime animal rights and environmental activist.Her new documentary explores the rise of so-called factory farming in America and some of the potential alternatives to meat. The film is an adaptation of the 2009 best-selling book, ""Eating Animals,"" by Jonathan Safran Foer, which Portman said was an ""eye opening"" read.CBS News""He... is writing letters to these companies producing the meat saying, `Can I see how the meat is produced because I want to know whether to feed it to my kids or not.` Which is, you know, if you called Welch`s grape juice or Lay`s potato chips, they`d take you on a tour of their factory. And it`s completely closed, the meat industry, you cannot see behind the curtain,"" Portman said Friday on ""CBS This Morning.""""It`s because [the conditions] would be appalling to any of us,"" Portman added. ""And it`s 99-point-something percent. It`s almost all meat is produced this way and dairy and eggs.""The factory farms are not what an average person might envision of a farm, Portman said: ""We think grass, and a barn, and a farmer.""""This is mass-produced animals in very, very tight conditions. Millions together and not being able to roam.""In the documentary, they spoke with industry experts and advocates about our country`s eating habits. Not only are the conditions of these farms concerning, they can also have a toxic impact on the environment, Portman said.""It`s the number one contributor to pollution, more than cars. I mean if you care about the environment, you should care about factory farming and, you know, changing farming practices,"" Portman said.""The people who used to do it well, the real farmers, the American farmers, salt-of-the-earth people, are not being supported,"" Portman said. ""And it`s a really corporate system that`s pushing them out and creating a very inhumane way of creating our food.""""Eating Animals"" is in select theaters Friday.We reached out to several agencies and associations in the meat and farming industries for their reactions, which are published in full below:USDAUSDA does not dictate the size of farms. That is determined by private property owners and the free market. A successful agricultural industry is vital to our nation. The average age of farmers is increasing, and USDA is focused on helping ensure the success of new farmers joining this vital industry to continue the legacy of caring for our land and forests, and producing the food and fiber upon which our nation depends. We at USDA provide this critical support to both beginning and established farmers through a variety of voluntary programs. This past fiscal year, USDA provided loans to more than 25,000 beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers. While pursuing a new career in farming may seem daunting, we have created a new website, located at newfarmers.usda.gov, to make it easier to connect new farmers with the grant programs and USDA resources they need to succeed. And, while the success of the agricultural sector is vital to our nation, so too is being good stewards of our land to ensure future production. Through its natural resources conservation efforts, USDA helps ensure the health of our air, water, soil, and habitat so working lands can keep working for generations to come. Between 2014 and 2017, we`ve invested more than $10 billion in putting voluntary conservation on the ground.U.S. Poultry & Egg AssociationConsumers want to be sure that all animals being raised for food are treated with respect and are properly cared for during their lives. The people and companies involved in raising poultry for food share the public`s concern. They recognize that they have an ethical obligation to make sure that the birds on their farms are well cared for and flourishing.Family farmers own and operate the majority of the poultry farms in the United States, and here is a link to one poultry farmer`s thoughts on family versus factory farming.The top priority of these farmers is to raise healthy, top quality poultry using national animal welfare guidelines and audit checklists. These guidelines cover every phase of the bird`s life and offers science-based recommendations for humane treatment.Modern poultry breeding practices produces birds that thrive in today`s poultry facilities. As a result, these birds are a much healthier and faster-growing stock than the birds of years ago. These birds are raised in large, spacious barns, which are sophisticated, secure facilities with strictly controlled temperature, humidity and ventilation systems inside ‰ÛÒ providing vital protection from the outdoor elements, disease and predators.Today, all poultry farms are under a health program designed by a licensed veterinarian. But just like people though, chickens, hens and turkeys sometimes get sick, and treating illness is a responsible and ethical component of animal care for these birds. When this happens, farmers work with animal health experts and veterinarians to determine if an antibiotic is needed. The vast majority of the antibiotics used by the poultry industry are never used in human medicine, and our industry has phased out many of those most critical to human medicine and continues to seek innovation to further reduce usage of antibiotics.Poultry producers are committed to innovation, and the work that farmers and veterinarians are doing to ensure the safety and health of their birds ‰ÛÒ and thereby our food supply ‰ÛÒ creates many choices for consumers. Whether consumers choose to spend their food dollars on traditional poultry, organic, or poultry raised without antibiotics, they can be confident in its wholesomeness and safety.National Pork Producers CouncilAt 4:58 PM ET last night, the National Pork Producers Council received an e-mail from CBS This Morning asking for comment on Ms. Portman`s project. We haven`t seen her documentary. Despite the last-minute request, and because we are aware of Ms. Portman`s long-standing anti-meat agenda, we offered to send a pig farmer to New York to participate in this segment to make sure CBS viewers are provided with a balanced view of U.S. pork production practices. Our offer was rejected.The success and viability of hog farms across rural American depend on maintaining the highest standards of animal care and the strongest possible commitment to environmental and community stewardship. While we may not offer the ratings boost that comes with hosting a Hollywood star ‰ÛÒ one with the resources to manufacture an image of livestock farmers that supports her agenda -- our offer to CBS stands. We welcome the opportunity to present an accurate view of a U.S. farming sector that employs 550,000 Americans and provides a safe and nutritious source of protein to billions of people worldwide.It is this type of biased reporting that has left the U.S. media vulnerable to questions about their credibility and accuracy."

2018/6/16,"Trump continues to falsely claim there`s a law on family separation, blames Democrats","WASHINGTON -- Roughly 50 children a day are being taken from their parents after they cross the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). But on Friday, President Trump insisted he`s not the one separating families.""The Democrats forced that law upon our nation. I hate it,"" he said.The fact that there is no such law did not stop the president from repeating his assertion half a dozen times.""The Democrats have to change their law, that`s their law,"" he said. ""That`s the Democrats` law. We can change it tonight!""Democrats said what Mr. Trump should change is a ""zero tolerance"" policy announced on May 7 by his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions. It means that asylum seekers who would previously have been released pending a hearing are now held behind bars, and their children are sent to separate shelters like a former Walmart in Brownsville, Texas.The policy prompted dozens of protests across the country on Friday, as Republican leaders tried to craft a bill that would at least allow parents and children be detained together. But on ""Fox and Friends"" Friday morning, Mr. Trump appeared to reject the plan.""I certainly wouldn`t sign the more moderate one,"" he said. ""I need a bill that gives this country tremendous border security.""Republicans, who have been working on the plan with the White House, were stunned.""I don`t think we`re sure what bill he is actually commenting on, so we`re waiting for him to clarify,"" said Rep.

""It`s an executive action by the attorney general.

2018/6/16,Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with wire fraud,"Federal prosecutors indicted Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and former chief operating officer Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani for allegedly defrauding investors, doctors and patients, federal prosecutors announced Friday. They were charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud.The indictment alleges that Holmes and Balwani used ads and solicitations to encourage doctors and patients to use Theranos` blood testing technology, even though they knew it was not capable of producing accurate and reliable results. The indictment also alleges that Holmes and Balwani made numerous misrepresentations to potential investors about Theranos` financial condition.""This indictment alleges a corporate conspiracy to defraud financial investors,"" said FBI Special Agent John F. Bennett in a press release from the U.S. Attorney`s Office in the northern district of California ""This conspiracy misled doctors and patients about the reliability of medical tests that endangered health and lives.""Theranos marketed technology that could perform laboratory tests from a pinprick of blood from the finger. Holmes had called it ""the most important technology in the world.""At its height, Theranos was worth nearly $10 billion and Holmes was the youngest, self-made female billionaire in the world. Theranos` board of directors once included Henry Kissinger, Defense Secretary James Mattis and former Secretary of State George P. Shultz.A former Theranos employee told Norah O`Donnell on ""60 Minutes"" that the ""revolutionary technology,"" named Edison, never really worked. Other former employees alleged that some blood samples returned contradictory and inconclusive results when retested, and that Holmes lied to Walgreens when she told them Edison was ready to use on patients, leading to a partnership that planned to put the device in every store.""She deceived everyone. Everyone,"" O`Donnell told ""60 Minutes Overtime."" ""She had hundreds of employees from MIT, from Harvard, from Apple. The smartest people in Silicon Valley went to work for her. They believed in her. It was not just the media. It was the people who gave her $900 million dollars.

2018/6/16,Report: Woman seeking asylum separated from disabled grandson,
2018/6/16,"Trump makes misleading claims about Crimea, FBI, North Korea","President Trump`s unexpected Friday morning media blitz allowed him to share his opinions on a host of contentious issues, from his performance at the Singapore summit with North Korea`s Kim Jong Un to the Department of Justice inspector general`s report that was released Thursday.But not all of his claims stand up to scrutiny, with the president sometimes making misleading or outright false statements about President Obama and his own campaign team.Here`s a look at some of his statements of Friday and the reality behind them:Paul ManafortPresident Trump: ""Manafort has nothing to do with campaign...Worked for me for a very short period of time -- worked for many other Republicans -- he worked for me for 49 days or something.""The facts: Paul Manafort, a longtime Republican strategist and lobbyist, joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 and was put in charge of persuading GOP convention delegates to back Mr. Trump. This was seen as a crucial task at the time, because while Mr. Trump was on his way to winning the nomination through the primaries, many in the GOP at the time were discussing ways to block him at the convention and give the nod to someone else.""Paul is a great asset and an important addition as we consolidate the tremendous support we have received in the primaries,"" Mr. Trump said in a statement as Manafort came aboard.In May, Manafort was promoted to campaign chairman, setting up a power struggle with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who had limited political experience before joining the Trump campaign. Within a few weeks, Manafort had cemented control of the Trump campaign and Lewandowski was fired. Mr. Trump then avoided a floor fight at the convention and secured the GOP nomination for president.On August 19, however, Mr. Trump announced that he accepted Manafort`s resignation. ""I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process,"" Mr. Trump said at the time. ""Paul is a true professional and I wish him the greatest success.""Given Manafort`s severe legal troubles stemming from his relationship with a pro-Russia party in Ukraine and his status as a target of special counsel Robert Mueller`s probe, it makes sense that Mr. Trump is trying to distance himself from his old campaign chairman. But the fact remains that Manafort, far from having nothing to do with the campaign, was a central force within it at a crucial juncture.Obama and CrimeaPresident Trump: ""President Obama lost Crimea, just so you understand...President Obama lost Crimea. Because Putin didn`t respect President Obama, Obama lost Crimea. President Obama, not Trump.""The facts: Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was removed from office amid widespread protests in February 2014. In response, Russia annexed the strategically important Crimean peninsula in the Black Sea, which is home to major Russian naval assets.Short of all-out war, there was little the Obama administration could have done to prevent Russia from overrunning Crimea. However, the U.S. did respond with strict sanctions in league with its European allies. Russia`s invasion and absorption of Crimea was also widely condemned by the broader international community, which further isolated Moscow.On CBS News ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Obama national security adviser Susan Rice said that attempts to blame the Crimean crisis on the previous administration were absurd.""The fact of the matter is, Russia had invaded Georgia,"" Rice said. ""It then invaded the Ukraine. We rallied the entire European Union and many other partners to impose tough sanctions on Russia for its annexation. We supported the Ukrainian government to build up its defensive military capacity. And, along with our G7 partners, we agreed that Russia should no longer be part of this community of the G8...The United States has long upheld international law. This was the most brazen violation of another country`s sovereignty that has occurred in recent years.""The DOJ inspector general reportPresident Trump: ""I think the report yesterday, maybe more importantly than anything, totally exonerates me. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction.""The facts: The Justice Department inspector general report does not address the questions of obstruction or collusion on Mr. Trump or anyone associated with him. Rather, the report examines the investigation into Hillary Clinton`s email server, offering a stern rebuke for the behavior of some Bureau officials, including then-director James Comey and agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. However, it also found that while some agents may have been biased against Mr. Trump, the decision not to prosecute Clinton was the correct one.The report suggests Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Russia investigations, may have acted improperly. During its investigation, the inspector general uncovered text messages Strzok exchanged with top FBI lawyer Lisa Page.In August 2016, Page texted Strzok asking: ""[Trump] is not ever going to become president, right? Right?!""Strzok replied, ""No. No he won`t. We`ll stop it.""Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz concluded that in the thousands of texts, Strzok and Page were critical of both candidates and ""brought discredit to themselves and sowed doubt about the FBI "" in its handling of the Clinton and then the Russia investigations. But the inspector general did not find political considerations affected the outcome of either agent`s work.So while the report is at times a damning indictment of the behavior of some FBI officials, it in no way ""exonerates"" Mr. Trump from any of the allegations Mueller is investigating.Were we at the brink of war with North Korea?President Trump: ""I want to have a good relationship with North Korea, I want to have a good relationship with many other countries, and what I`ve done, if you remember - if you`re fair - which most of you aren`t, but if you`re fair, but when I came in people thought we were probably going to war with North Korea.""The facts: Since the end of the Cold War, North Korea`s quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them have repeatedly confounded American presidents. Various attempts have been made since the 1990s to prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons and ICBMs. However, they have all been unsuccessful.In a sense, this has put the U.S. and North Korea on a collision course for years. But the most recent war worries really stem from the summer of 2017, when North Korea was testing new rockets and nuclear weapons at an accelerated rate. In August 2017, Mr. Trump promised that North Korea ""will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"" should they continue threatening the U.S. North Korea`s threats, however, did not stop, leading to fears that war could break out on the Korean peninsula.While it`s possible to argue that the U.S. and North Korea were looking like they would soon be at loggerheads when Mr. Trump took office, that elides the fact that tensions quickly escalated once he took office."

To most of us that sounds like heaven, right? To Tapp it was overwhelming. All the sounds, smells and people were making his head spin. One day he was Inmate No. 56265 in the Idaho State Correctional Center, and the next he was trying to choose a side dish from six different options.CBS NewsImagine spending two decades behind bars, where you have no choices at all.

He answered, yes, but it costs 35 cents a packet at the canteen (like the ketchup packets we all grab in handfuls at fast food chains). When you are living on $200 a month, Tapp explained, 35 cents is a lot of money for a little steak sauce.As Chris Tapp makes his way, he will most likely be overwhelmed by the many choices ahead of him. But it was clear from his first supper that he has a lot of support, as he decides what to do with the rest of his life."
2018/6/17,Houston warehouse eyed as new shelter for immigrant children,"HOUSTON -- An agency in Texas that contracts with the federal government to house thousands of immigrant children has signed a lease to turn a Houston warehouse into a temporary shelter. The Houston Chronicle reports that the application submitted to the state by Southwest Key Programs requests a license to hold up to 240 children.Southwest Key operates several other facilities in Texas for children who were detained after illegally crossing the border on their own or who were separated from their parents after entering as a family.In the coming days, federal officials will open a shelter in far West Texas for hundreds of children.Many facilities in the U.S. government network that house children are at -- or close to -- capacity.On Thursday, the government released video showing the inside of a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) facility that`s sheltering children who entered the country illegally. The facility is a former Walmart in Brownsville, Texas, not far from the Mexican border, and it`s nearly filled to capacity.The video selectively highlights young kids doing outdoor activities, receiving medical care and even playing with the residential pet dog. It houses just boys, ages 10 to 17.The facility, known as Casa Padre, is the largest shelter facility in the U.S. for minors caught crossing the border illegally. But over the last month, the number of boys housed there has increased from around 1,200 to 1,500. While the majority of children at Casa Padre are kids who arrived at the border unaccompanied, it`s estimated that about five percent, or 70 boys, are living there because they were separated from their parents at the border.From April 19 to May 31 this year, 1,995 minors were separated from 1,940 adults at the border, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Friday. The figures included separations for illegal entry, immigration violations, or possible criminal conduct by the adult, and they took place during a crackdown on illegal entries. An age breakdown was not provided.Under a ""zero tolerance"" policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Department of Homeland Security officials are now referring all cases of illegal entry for criminal prosecution. U.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are."
2018/6/17,"Transcript: Reps. Steve Scalise, Cedric Richmond on ""Face the Nation,"" June 17, 2018","House Majority Whip Steve Scalise played in the annual congressional baseball game this week, one year after he was nearly killed by a gunman while practicing for last year`s game.Scalise and Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond met while both served in the Louisiana legislature. They both joined us to discuss the shooting, their friendship and the current state of discourse in Washington.The following is a transcript of the interview with Scalise and Richmond that aired Sunday, June 17, 2018, on ""Face the Nation.""MARGARET BRENNAN: They`ve been called the Bayou Brothers: Democrat Cedric Richmond and Republican Steve Scalise have been friends since they served in the Louisiana statehouse; now they`re both eyeing higher leadership roles in the U.S. Congress. A year ago, Scalise was critically wounded in an attack on Republican members of Congress practicing for a charity baseball game. Richmond was the first person to get to Scalise`s side after he arrived at the hospital, their friendship proving that even those divided in politics, can still be good friends. We spoke with them earlier.MARGARET BRENNAN: So many people look at that shooting, the political motivations behind it, as reflective of the divisions in this country. But you`re sitting here talking about being close friends despite this divide. Which is more reflective of where we are right now as a country?MAJ. WHIP STEVE SCALISE: We`re a divided nation right now. But, if you look back at the history of our country, I mean, our founders set up a system of government where, with the rights of free speech, the - the ability - you can go out and disagree with people and you can actually express those disagreements. In many countries you can`t. The difference is you - number one, you should never make those disagreements personal. But there`s no excuse, it`s completely unacceptable, to resort to violence to try to resolve some kind of disagreement when you have somebody with - that you have with them politically.REP. CEDRIC RICHMOND: Well, look, the division in this country right now, I believe, is at one of the highest peaks during my generation, and hopefully we can start to bridge that divide by leading by example. And it will have to come from Congress. That`s clear. But we just need to make sure that we judge people by a whole bunch of factors, but it shouldn`t be political parties, shouldn`t be race, shouldn`t be gender, shouldn`t be sexual orientation. It should just be whether the person is a nice person or not. And to the extent that you agree that the person is a nice person, then you try to find common ground. And look, Steve and I - our battles, even our plane rides home, when we talk about issues, it`s clear we don`t necessarily agree on most of them how to get there. And-MARGARET BRENNAN: That`s everything, that`s healthcare, that`s immigration--REP. SCALISE: Tax cuts.MARGARET BRENNAN: --that`s tax cuts.REP. RICHMOND: The - the list goes on, and-MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you argue?REP. RICHMOND: We, we do.REP. SCALISE: I win all the arguments but, I mean, he still keeps voting the wrong way.REP. RICHMOND: Well - the good news is, we look at the Affordable Care Act, and we look at how it`s improving lives around the country, and I get to--REP. SCALISE: And doubling the cost of healthcare every year.REP. RICHMOND: I get to say ‰ÛÒ no, that`s only because you all have gutted all the good things in it that keeps costs down. But so we have this, a lot, where we talk about issues, and you know, we tease each other a lot. We like to say that Democrats are tax and spend Democrats, although they just spent two trillion dollars on a tax cut that they didn`t pay for--REP. SCALISE: Spending money by giving people their money back. You know, interesting, when he only cares about the deficit when it involves letting people have their own money back.REP. RICHMOND: Well, you know, you have to pay for two trillion dollars that`s a lot of money.REP. SCALISE: You do it by growing the economy.REP. RICHMOND: So he likes to win arguments. I win the baseball games.REP. SCALISE: We`ll give him the trophy. You know there`s a trophy for showing up. We`ll give that to Cedric. We`ll win the policy.REP. RICHMOND: You know, for now. But look, November 6th right around the corner.MARGARET BRENNAN: What`s the over-under on that? Do you place bets on things like that?REP. SCALISE: I bet that probably Cedric--MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you`ve talked about it.REP. SCALISE: --wins reelection in his district somehow, and I`ll win re-election in mine. We`re going to hold the House though.MARGARET BRENNAN: You`re not betting on him as speaker? You said he would be a good speaker if he wanted to step into this race.REP. RICHMOND: Yeah, I want him to be the head Republican. I do. I just want him to be in the minority. And we will be in the majority, so--REP. SCALISE: Cedric would make a great minority leader. When we hold the majority, I look forward to having Cedric work with us. He`ll be - he`ll be minority leader maybe, but he - he and I`ll be able to work on - work on a number of things.MARGARET BRENNAN: What about on immigration?REP. SCALISE: Yeah.MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any points of agreement?REP. SCALISE: I mean, shouldn`t we secure the border? I`m sure in our bill we`re going to make sure we build the wall. And we also solve the DACA problem, but we fix some of the problems that stop us from securing the border. A lot of the interi - internal security measures - Secretary Nielsen of Homeland Security has identified so many different loopholes that make it hard to actually secure America`s border. Let`s fix those.MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think for the country it`s important have a vote on immigration ahead of November for both parties?REP. RICHMOND: Well I - I think so because I think the American people should know where we are. I mean, the head of their party who occupies the White House said very early on, ""If you give me border security, if you give me a wall, then I`m willing to create a pathway to citizenship for DACAs. If you all get it passed I`ll sign it."" But then - and this is where it always gets contentious - he throws in the Diversity Visa Program, which is the largest program in which African-Americans come to this country. They`re better educated than even American children when they get here. So, you know, those are the hard things. His role in - in Congress gets complicated a little bit because you have to introduce the president. If we didn`t have a White House involved, I think there are a bunch of issues we could have - we could come together on.MARGARET BRENNAN: We also spoke with the two about their different perspectives on both President Trump and race in America. That conversation is available on our website, FaceTheNation.com."

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are both off by 0.5 percent.Tariffs imposed by the world`s two biggest economies are set to take effect on July 6, ratcheting up a trade dispute that has been simmering for months. President Donald Trump has announced a 25 percent tariff on up to $50 billion of Chinese products. China is retaliating by raising import duties on $34 billion worth of American goods, including soybeans, electric cars and whiskey.The heightened tensions are creating increased uncertainty for U.S. businesses that operate internationally, and there are fears that rising prices and supply chain disruption will in turn hurt consumer confidence.""Individual US sectors ranging from agriculture to aerospace are vulnerable to retaliation by China. Thus the growth and inflation impact on the US economy will depend in large part on China`s response, as well as the impact trade tensions have on global growth,"" Madhavi Bokil, senior credit officer at Moody`s, said in a note on Friday.Losses were across the board. Machine maker Caterpillar shed 1.3 percent, chip maker Intel dropped 3.2 percent and biotech company Biogen dropped 4.6 percent.Menswear brand Perry Ellis is down 2.1 percent. Its founder, George Feldenkreis, is buying more stock and taking the company private for $437 million.With investors worried about a trade war, bonds rose.

2018/6/19,How Trump`s immigration policy is playing out along the Texas border,"McALLEN, Texas -- Video provided by the U.S. government of the immigration facility housing hundreds of people was released Monday. A day before, the media was given 15 minutes to write down what was seen in person at the facility. Reporters couldn`t bring cameras. Inside, men, women and children are kept in large cages. They are segregated according to how they crossed the border.""It`s not just a very simple issue of separating the families. We have to look at this broader and without emotion and objectively,"" said Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Chief Manuel Padilla Jr. ""We actually have to do something about the current immigration law that has many loopholes.""Asked if illegal immigration has become so bad that separating families is the best way to deter people from coming illegally, Padilla said it`s ""one of the only options.""The detention process is complex, with many variables. But generally under the Trump administration`s zero tolerance approach, parents are subject to criminal proceedings, and minors are reclassified as unaccompanied alien children. The maximum holding time for them is 72 hours before they are placed in one of approximately 100 shelters.U.S. Customs and Border ProtectionThe goal is placement with a family member already living in the U.S. If a parent seeking a claim of asylum is denied, the policy is for them to be reunited with their child, but the process could take weeks.Rudy Cisneros is a Mexican-American Army veteran and reacted to what is happening in McAllen.""Not taking away from what these kids are going through, and I understand people want a better life, but there`s a process and we`re a nation of laws,"" he said. ""Whether you like him or not, Trump, he at least is trying to do something to secure our country.""Belinda Garcia might seem like someone who would support the president`s policies. She lives a quarter-mile from the Rio Grande River where migrants swim across and then run through her backyard. She says her fence is bent because of it.Yet she doesn`t the support zero tolerance policy of prosecuting every person who enters illegally, and she doesn`t want to see families separated. She doesn`t even support the president`s border wall.""I don`t think they should be prosecuted just because they`re crossing the border,"" she added."

2018/6/19,"Sessions says comparing separated children`s quarters to Nazi Germany is an ""exaggeration""","Attorney General Jeff Sessions called comparisons made between Nazi Germany and the federal government`s treatment of migrant children separated from their parents at the border an ""exaggeration"" during an interview Monday night.Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked the nation`s chief law enforcement officer to respond to his critics` comparisons between Nazi German`s treatment of Jews, and the facilities where the federal government is housing children separated from their parents. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and former CIA director Michael Hayden, among others, have suggested some parallels between the present situation and Nazi Germany.""Well it`s a real exaggeration,"" Sessions responded on ""The Ingraham Angle."" ""Of course, in Nazi Germany, they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country. But this is a serious matter. We need to think it through, be rational and thoughtful about it.""Sessions` zero-tolerance policy of illegal border crossings and the decision to treat those crossings as criminal offenses has separated at least 2,000 children from their parents since April, and the White House has declined so far to stop separating minors and their parents. The separations, and images of the children`s living conditions, has sparked outrage on both sides of the aisle, and even Sessions` own church issued church charges against the decision.Mr. Trump has demanded that Congress ""CHANGE THE LAWS"" to fix the immigration problem, but so far the White House has not said whether Mr. Trump will sign a stand-alone bill to fix the issue, introduced by members of his own party.

2018/6/19,Is it really possible for John Cena to get his vasectomy reversed?,"In a dramatic reality TV finale, actor and wrestler John Cena said that he`s willing to reverse his vasectomy so he and his girlfriend can have children, according to People magazine. The announcement came on the midseason finale of the show ""Total Bellas"" on the E! network, which stars Nikki Bella, who is in a relationship Cena.It`s certainly a sweet sentiment, wanting to regain your ability to father a kid. But with a birth control method as severe as a vasectomy ‰ÛÓ in which the tube that transports semen is literally cut in half ‰ÛÓ is going back even possible? [Trying to Conceive: 12 Tips for Men]Vasectomies are widely considered a permanent form of birth control, said Dr. Ajay Nangia, a professor and vice chair of urology at the University of Kansas Health Center who specializes in the surgery. (Nangia is not involved in Cena`s case.) During the procedure, doctors cut into the skin surrounding each testicle and clip out a small piece of the vas deferens, one of the small canals responsible for shuttling sperm out of storage and into the urethra, through which they normally leave the body. But with their pathway to the rest of the ejaculate fluids cut off due to a vasectomy, sperm can`t leave the body.As irreversible as this sounds, undoing vasectomies is not only possible, but somewhat popular: About 6 percent of men end upwanting the process reversed, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. To ""undo"" a vasectomy, surgeons return to the site of the initial cut and bring together the two halves of the vas deferens using extremely delicate stitches. The thread used to reattach the tubes is thinner than a human hair, and the procedure requires an operating microscope that makes everything look 25 times larger, Nangia told Live Science. ""It`s like putting two tips of a pin together.""The process described above is the most straightforward approach to reversing a vasectomy. However, the procedure may sometimes be more complicated.For example, if the original vasectomy removed a large section of the vas deferens ‰ÛÓ 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) instead of the typical 0.4 inches (1 cm) ‰ÛÓ it might be harder to stretch the tubes enough to close the gap, Nangia said.The procedure can also become more complex if the surgeon sees a toothpaste-like buildup in the cut tube. That means the original surgery caused some blockage. If the surgeon can`t remove this blockage, the doctor may have to attach one half of the vas deferens to a different sperm tunnel and reroute the ejaculation path, Nangia said. In other words, the two halves of the vas deferens wouldn`t be re-attached where they were originally cut.Reversing a vasectomy is only one part of the equation, however. The goal of the reversal is to be able to conceive naturally. [Future of Fertility Treatment: 7 Ways Baby-Making Could Change]So, the ultimate question, is how many of these reattachments end in pregnancy?Certain factors ‰ÛÓ such as scarring from the procedures, how long ago the original cut happened and the use of hormonal supplements, including testosterone ‰ÛÓ can reduce the number of sperm in the ejaculate, Nangia said. And if there are fewer sperm in each ejaculation, the odds of pregnancy can also depend on the partner`s fertility. All these elements explain why the success rate for men who have reversed vasectomies falls somewhere between 40 and 90 percent, according to the Mayo Clinic. Or, more precisely: about 90 percent of reversals resulted in sperm making it through the final stretch, while 50 percent ended in pregnancy, according to one of the only studies that`s given the odds a close look.Simply put, there`s a good chance that a man who vows to reverse his vasectomy will be able to follow through on his promise. For men who have vasectomy and are unable to conceive naturally after the operation, in-vitro fertilization, with sperm retrieved from the man, is another possible option.And while he`s trying to get a family started, contraceptive researchers might have finally reached the next frontier of sperm blocking: glue. As Nangia put it, vasectomy surgery hasn`t changed much in the last 30 to 40 years, but ""everyone is looking for the holy grail of a glue that can block [the tubes] without [the need for] cutting,"" he said. (One such ""glue"" was successfully used to prevent pregnancy in monkeys in a 2017 study.)Originally published on Live Science."

S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Tuesday that Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will replace the conglomerate in the blue-chip index on June 26.GE had been the only remaining original member of the Dow -- it joined in 1896 but was booted twice in its early years -- and had been a regular in the index since 1907.""Walgreens is a national retail drugstore chain offering prescription and nonprescription drugs, related health services and general goods,"" David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement. ""Today`s change to the DJIA will make the index a better measure of the economy and the stock market.""A better measure indeed. GE`s lackluster performance in recent years has made it an outlier compared with other Dow components, heightening expectations on Wall Street that an exit from the index was likely.GE has struggled with a turnaround under new CEO John Flannery Jr., who has called the company a ""self-help story"" and referred to 2018 as a ""reset year."" The question is whether he has the capability and determination to achieve the seemingly impossible goal of revamping the venerable company.Although GE gradually climbed its way out of a hole following the Great Recession, its results have left much to be desired for investors. Among its chief problems: dwindling demand for its gas turbines, earnings far below estimates and a cash shortage that prompted it to slash its stock dividend.Adding to its woes, the company disclosed in January that it faces a probe of its accounting by securities regulators, and it announced a month later that it was reshuffling its board.Kate Gibson contributed reporting."

The policy keeps in place key components of the administration`s ""zero tolerance"" policy of prosecuting illegal border crossings along the U.S-Mexico border. While the administration will continue prosecuting crimes of ""improper entry,"" the administration will ""maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources,"" according to the order`s text.In a shift from previous policy, families will now be held together during the process of prosecution and deportation at the border.""We are keeping families together and this will solve that problem.

You can desire recognition and, at the same time, decide to not play in the confines of the game as it`s set up.""The actress, though, is no stranger to good deeds. In 2016, Rodriguez loaned her first Golden Globes dress to a fan, who wore it to her senior prom."
2018/6/21,"New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern gives birth to ""healthy baby girl""","WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gave birth to a daughter Thursday and posted a photo welcoming the healthy newborn ""to our village."" She is the second elected world leader to give birth while holding office after late Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who gave birth to daughter Bakhtawar in 1990.Ardern posted a photo on her Instagram account showing her and partner Clarke Gayford with the baby at Auckland City Hospital. The girl arrived at 4:45 p.m. weighing 7.3 pounds.""Welcome to our village wee one,"" Ardern wrote in the photo caption. ""Feeling very lucky to have a healthy baby girl.""She thanked everyone for their kindness and wishes. ""We`re all doing really well,"" she wrote.Ardern`s pregnancy has been followed around the world, with many hoping the 37-year-old will become a role model for combining motherhood with political leadership.Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said in an email to The Associated Press that it was a very happy day for Ardern and Gayford and that New Zealanders had taken the news of the pregnancy in their stride.""This is a sign of our maturity as a country and its acceptance that combining career and family is a choice which women are free to make,"" she wrote. ""Let`s also celebrate Clarke as a modern man who is happy to be the full time parent of a young child.""The former prime minister said attitudes had changed since she`d entered politics and that was a good thing.""For New Zealand, these events and the way our country has greeted them will be seen as inspirational by all who advocate for gender equality and women`s empowerment,"" Clark wrote.Jennifer Curtin, a professor of politics at the University of Auckland, said there was symbolic importance in Ardern giving birth, in that it showed political parties around the world that it was fine to have younger women as candidates.She said women often tended to be older when they entered politics. She said in other fields, women have been combining motherhood and paid work for decades, but it has only recently become more manageable thanks to paid parental leave.Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters has taken over as acting prime minister. Ardern plans to take six weeks of leave before returning to work.Under the arrangement, Ardern will still be consulted on major decisions, including issues of national security. She has said she`s confident the government will continue to run smoothly in her absence.She said that after the birth, she hoped to have some quiet time to enjoy as a family.Asked earlier this month how the couple had been faring in their quest to choose a baby name, Ardern responded: ""Terribly. Do you have any suggestions?"""
2018/6/22,Expedition Antarctica: A father and son`s journey to save the planet,"Thirty-two years ago, Robert Swan made history as the first person to walk to both poles. Even as a young man, these grueling expeditions took a harsh toll on his body. Passing directly beneath the hole in the ozone layer, Swan`s face became badly burned and his eyes even changed color. But the Arctic explorer now says that all of that physical duress pales in comparison to the agony of watching his son go through the same experience 32 years later.This past winter, after years of preparation, Robert Swan set out to trek the 600 miles to the South Pole again -- this time, with his 24-year-old son Barney by his side. And this time, with an additional challenge built in: they would survive exclusively off of renewable energy.It was a ""swan song"" with a very important goal. If the father-son team could get by on renewable energy in the harshest environment on Earth, then people in the comfort of their own homes could do it, too.Shell - Technical Partner""At the age of 61, it`s not really something that people should do,"" Swan told CBSN Originals of his decision to undertake the difficult journey across Antarctica a second time. ""But Barney convinced me that together as father and son, together as the millennial generation and the older generation, we need to join together because this can`t be a bunch of young people thinking one thing and a bunch of old people thinking another. We`ve got to join together because we are in a survival situation on planet Earth.""The success of the expedition necessitated the pioneering of new equipment that would use renewable energy to melt snow and ice into hot water on the move in the Antarctic. So, while Robert had previously used jet fuel to cook his food and keep warm in the -40-degree temperatures, this time he and his son used biofuels derived from wood chips to do the job. They used solar panels, provided by NASA, that plugged into their sleds to melt ice and snow into drinkable water.Shell - Technical Partner""We`re attempting to do something that no other expedition has tried yet in the hope to really show that these technologies can work, not only in our own nations, in our own homes, but in the world`s most hostile place,"" Barney explains in the CBSN Originals documentary, ""Expedition Antarctica,"" as he and his father are preparing to set off on their unprecedented journey.While the energy sources sustaining them were different, Antarctica`s climate was as unforgiving as ever. And once again, the combination of subzero temperatures and strenuous physical activity began taking a harsh toll on Robert`s body.""His legs, his inner thigh, everywhere in between, it was like repellant,"" Barney recalled to CBS News. ""We`re talking like bits of flesh falling off him. He was decaying. And to think that all it takes is that one degree too far and you could die; I was literally watching my father on the slow road to death.""Shell - Technical PartnerRobert finally realized that in order for the expedition to succeed he would have to bow out. The team had to keep up its pace or risk running out of food and fuel; slowing down or waiting until he recovered weren`t options. So he made arrangements for a helicopter to transport him back to base camp, and he made the excruciating decision to leave Barney behind to finish what they`d started.""It was the worst moment of my life for the simple reason that I knew what lay ahead,"" Robert recalled through tears in an interview at Davos. ""I felt a failure as an expedition leader. I felt a failure for my son. I felt absolutely appalling, but I knew that this expedition wasn`t about Robert Swan. This expedition was about inspiring people on energy use. It was about doing the right thing and the right thing for me to do was to put myself second and the expedition first. I just had to, for once in my life, realize my limitations. And I went back to the base camp and had the worst week of my life, dealing with the word failure. And I had to listen to what was happening with my son`s feet. His toes were turning black. ... And I was sitting there thinking, `I should be there.`""Barney, however, didn`t see his father`s decision as a failure. On the contrary, the 24-year-old, whose toe was turning black due to the brutal negative-40-degree temperatures and repeated banging on his boots, was overcome with pride for his dad.""I don`t think I`ve ever been as proud of my dad,"" an emotional Barney told CBS News. ""It takes courage to tell your team you don`t have it in you, and that`s what he did today.""Barney, more determined than ever, continued on toward the south geographic pole. And when he was 60 miles from the goal, Robert choppered back in to join him, so that together, they could complete their mission.""It was a moment where I let go of so many things in life because he`d done it,"" Robert recalled, looking lovingly at his son. ""Those stupid words like `failure` and everything else disappeared because there he was in my arms.""Shell - Technical PartnerNow, father and son have both inked their names in the history books. They`ve risked their lives to send a dramatic message to the rest of the world about the feasibility of climate solutions. And they`ve proven that a passion for adventure, innovation and discovery just may be something that`s passed along, from generation to generation.""The last thing I said to Barney as I got on that plane,"" says an emotional Robert Swan, ""[was] just remember whose son you are. And my blood`s in your blood. And you can bloody do this.` And to do it, he had to go through hell and he`s still going through hell, but we did it."""
2018/6/22,Pete Davidson confirms engagement to Ariana Grande,"It`s official: ""Saturday Night Live"" star Pete Davidson and pop star Ariana Grande are engaged. Davidson confirmed on ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon"" Wednesday night that the two are planning to tie the knot.Fallon joked to Davidson, ""You know you didn`t have to get engaged to Ariana Grande just to come on our show,"" but Davidson joked back, ""But I did, though.""Davidson continued, ""I feel like I won a contest.""""It`s f**cking lit, Jimmy. It`s so lit,"" said the comedian. ""It`s so funny walking down the street because dudes are walking by and they`re like"" -- he tipped his hat, and the audience laughed. ""Did you ever see that Derek Jeter commercial where he`s retiring and everybody just tips their hats? Some dude came up to me and said, `Dude, you gave me hope.`""He also said happily, ""I am forever known as her plus-one.""The actor expressed dismay at how much attention his romance has gotten in the press, though. He said, ""Why do people care? It`s very weird. Like, the President is trying to pardon himself and he`s f**king a porn star. Like, shouldn`t we care about that?""Davidson also talked about a tattoo he got on his neck as a tribute to Grande. When Fallon said, ""I`ve seen it on the news,"" Davidson responded, ""Yeah! I did, too, apparently!""The couple got engaged earlier this month after weeks of dating and are reportedly living together in New York, per ET.In May, Grande spoke out about her breakup with Mac Miller after a fan hinted that she was to blame for Miller`s recent car accident. The statement came in response to a Twitter user who wrote, ""Mac Miller totalling his G wagon and getting a DUI after Ariana Grande dumped him for another dude after he poured his heart out on a ten song album to her called the divine feminine is just the most heartbreaking thing happening in Hollywood.""Grande penned a lengthy response in a screenshot on Twitter and said the user was minimizing ""female self-respect and self-worth."" She also implied that Miller can`t ""keep his s**t together.""""How absurd you minimize female self-respect and self-worth by saying someone should stay in a toxic relationship because he wrote an album about them, which btw isn`t the case (just Cinderella is ab me),"" Grande tweeted. ""I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be. I have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety & prayed for his balance for years (and always will of course) but shaming/blaming women for a man`s inability to keep his s**t together is a very major problem."""
