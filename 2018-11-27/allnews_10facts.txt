<h1 class="article__title">Fact-checking Donald Trump's statement on Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi murder</h1>
an
the
<p>President Donald Trump’s view that the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi should not touch U.S.-Saudi relations isn’t being well-received by his fellow Republicans.</p>
<p>For example, Trump cast doubt over the CIA’s conclusion that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing.</p>
<p>Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he disagreed with Trump.</p>
<p>"The intelligence I’ve seen suggests that this was ordered by the crown prince," Lee said on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/lee-i-disagree-with-the-president-s-assessment-on-saudi-arabia-1379872323632?v=railb&amp;cid=eml_pol_20181125">NBC News’ Meet the Press Nov. 25</a>.</p>
<p>Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, was more cautious, but she told <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1811/25/sotu.01.html">CNN’s State of the Union</a> that "when it becomes necessary, the president also needs to speak directly to the Saudis and say enough is enough."</p>
<p>Trump released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-donald-j-trump-standing-saudi-arabia/">statement about Saudi Arabia on Nov. 20</a>. It contained a number of questionable assertions, and we’ll go through them here.</p>
<p><strong>"Saudi Arabia would gladly withdraw from Yemen if the Iranians would agree to leave. They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance."</strong></p>
<p>After more than four years of civil strife, the humanitarian disaster in Yemen is enormous. Out of a population of 28 million, 11.3 million are in acute need in order to survive, according to the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/yemen-2018-humanitarian-needs-overview-enar">latest U.N. estimates</a>. More than 8 million people are at risk of famine.</p>
<p>The conflict involves many parties. The Houthi Shia Muslim rebel movement forced the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee in 2015. A Saudi-led coalition put Hadi’s government, with Hadi remaining outside the country, back in control of part of Yemen. Those are the two main armed groups, but the war has seen a changing mix of alliances with other factions.</p>
<p>Trump called the conflict in Yemen a proxy war, so the fairest reading of his words is that if Iran stopped backing the Houthis, Saudi Arabia’s opponents, then the Saudis would follow up with aid. The implication is that the Houthi forces would either strike a deal or collapse.</p>
<p>Gerald Feierstein, former U.S. ambassador to Yemen in the Obama administration, said under either condition, Saudi Arabia has put relief money on the table. Feierstein said at some point before 2016, the Saudis told him they offered billions if the Houthis stood down.</p>
<p>"The Saudis and Emiratis have also said publicly that they would find reconstruction and development programs in Yemen once the conflict ended," Feierstein told us.</p>
<p>Feierstein said the Saudi offer amounted to about $9 billion.</p>
<p>The catch, according to former CIA officer Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution, is that the civil war in Yemen is more complicated than just Iranian and Hezbollah support for the Houthis –– a charge that Iran denies.</p>
<p>The Saudi-led coalition wants to restore full power to Hadi, Riedel said. But groups that oppose the Houthis don’t necessarily want to see Hadi in control either.</p>
<p>"By placing the war solely as an Iranian-created conflict, Trump is trying to absolve the Saudis of responsibility," Riedel said.</p>
<p><strong>"After my heavily negotiated trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Kingdom agreed to spend and invest $450 billion in the United States."</strong></p>
<p>The $450 billion Trump repeatedly mentions comes without evidence. <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-touts-nonexistent-450-billion-saudi-o/">We have asked</a> the White House to show us what lies behind the $450 billion and have yet to get an answer.</p>
<p>Hossein Askari, a business professor at George Washington University, analyzes international trade in the Middle East. He knows of no tally of contracts to back up Trump’s assertion.</p>
<p>"There is absolutely no such number that could support the $450 billion," Askari said.</p>
<p>Part of the total would be $110 billion in arms sales that Trump claimed emerged from his visit to Saudi Arabia. Arms analysts told us that, at best, the figure is aspirational.</p>
<p>"The $110 billion is not even remotely solid," said U.S. Naval War College professor Jonathan Caverley in October. "The State Department only counts $14.5 billion in ‘implemented’ sales from this deal."</p>
<p>The $110 billion includes sales that have been in the pipeline from before the Trump administration took power. Complex weapons systems take years to play out.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.dsca.mil/sites/default/files/fiscal_year_series_-_30_september_2017.pdf#page=354">the past 10 years</a>, the United States and Saudi Arabia have had $85.5 billion in sales agreements, but only $24.5 billion in actual deliveries.</p>
<p>Some of the sales are speculative. For example, the United States approved the sale of a $13.5 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. But the Saudis let a September deadline to seal the deal come and go.</p>
<p>When Trump offered a version of this before, he suggested that over a million jobs were on the line. We rated that claim <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-touts-nonexistent-450-billion-saudi-o/">Pants on Fire</a>.</p>
<p><strong>"If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries — and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business."</strong></p>
<p>Could Saudi Arabia swap Russian or Chinese weapons for its American-made systems?</p>
<p>Not likely, said Rachel Stohl, director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, a Washington think tank.</p>
<p>"The Saudis have been reliant on U.S. and other Western governments’ weapons for years," Stohl told us. "It would be extremely difficult — from a parts, integration, and interoperability perspective — to simply switch to Chinese and Russian suppliers. It would be a very slow transition for the military to resupply its major systems to Russian and Chinese platforms."</p>
<p>In theory, Saudi Arabia could buy elsewhere, but in practice, the Gulf State nation has many reasons not to.</p>
<p><strong>"Representatives of Saudi Arabia say that Jamal Khashoggi was an ‘enemy of the state’ and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood."</strong></p>
<p>Trump claims this in the statement, but a search of the Nexis news database shows no mention of Saudi representatives saying publicly that Khashoggi was an enemy of the state or a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni Muslim group with chapters in many Arab countries.</p>
<p>Riedel said it was a theme developed "behind the scenes" — perhaps by the Saudis themselves. But in the United States, Trump supporters<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/conservatives-mount-a-whisper-campaign-smearing-khashoggi-in-defense-of-trump/2018/10/18/feb92bd0-d306-11e8-b2d2-f397227b43f0_story.html?utm_term=.7e01bd63bbb3"> began spreading the </a>idea.</p>
<p>Fox News host Harris Faulkner said Oct. 18 that "Khashoggi was tied to the Muslim Brotherhood." A conservative talk show CRTV <a href="https://twitter.com/CRTV/status/1052718404010995712">tweeted a segment </a>that said Khashoggi "was a radical activist with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood!" Donald Trump Jr. sent his followers a tweet that built on the message that Khashoggi was "<a href="https://twitter.com/pspoole/status/1050804806997151745">tooling around Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden</a> and al-Qaeda co-founder Abdullah Azzam."</p>
<p>The reality is that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/14/world/middleeast/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-arabia.html?">many years earlier</a>, Khashoggi had been drawn to Islamic movements, but he later distanced himself from radical movements. He met Osama bin Laden when, with CIA backing, bin Laden was fighting the Russians in Afghanistan. Khashoggi reported on him as a journalist.</p>
<p>When U.S. forces killed bin Laden, Khashoggi wrote of him, "You were beautiful and brave in those beautiful days in Afghanistan, before you surrendered to hatred and passion."</p>
<p>So perhaps Saudi officials told Trump that Khashoggi was a threat to the Saudi kingdom, but so far as anyone can tell, that was in private.</p>
<p><strong>"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event — maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!"</strong></p>
<p>According to news reports, the CIA has concluded that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s assassination. "The CIA’s assessment, in which officials have said they have high confidence, is the most definitive to date linking Mohammed to the operation," the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html?utm_term=.e1760787aa9b">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Lawmakers publicly sided with the CIA’s interpretation over Trump’s.</p>
<p>Echoing Lee, his Republican colleague, the incoming House Intelligence chairman, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/25/politics/adam-schiff-trump-khashoggi-cnntv/index.html">Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif.</a>, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he has been briefed by the CIA, "and while I cannot discuss the contents of the briefing in any way, I can say that I think the president is being dishonest with the American people."</p>
<p>Steven Aftergood, an intelligence specialist at the Federation of American Scientists, told PolitiFact that intelligence inherently "deals in uncertainties. So one could still say of almost any conclusion, ‘maybe he did and maybe he didn't!’ But this is a way of evading the substance of the judgment, which is that he almost certainly did order the assassination."</p>
<p><strong>"I understand there are members of Congress who, for political or other reasons, would like to go in a different direction — and they are free to do so."</strong></p>
<p>It’s not clear what political advantage members of Congress would find in opposing Trump’s stance on Saudi Arabia. Several lawmakers explicitly cited human rights as a reason for their concerns. For instance:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1064978268154138630">Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky</a><a href="https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1064978268154138630">.</a>: "The President indicates that Saudi Arabia is the lesser two evils compared to Iran and so the U.S. won’t punish Saudi Arabia for the brutal killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist in their consulate. I disagree."</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1064974701427073026">Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.</a>: "Our foreign policy must be about promoting our national interests. It is in our natl interest to defend human rights. (Human-rights) violations lead to mass migration, help extremism flourish &amp; often result in new governments hostile towards the U.S. because we supported their oppressors.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1064981571101487109">Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.</a>: "The President’s failure to hold Saudi Arabia responsible in any meaningful way for the death of Jamal Khashoggi is just one more example of this White House’s retreat from American leadership on issues like human rights and protecting the free press."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=FE630CC1-CD73-4DBB-9F70-A58DF3982D8C">Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.</a>: "I’m shocked that President Trump said there will be no punishment for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi… Human rights is more than just a phrase, it has to mean something. And that means standing up and condemning a brazen murder by a foreign government. Everyone who played a role in this killing must be held accountable."</p>
<p>The breadth of lawmakers’ expressed concern for human rights is unusually strong, advocates say.</p>
<p>"The strongly negative, bipartisan reaction to President Trump’s statement reflects widespread revulsion at the idea that the United States would be willing to avert its eyes from a blatant, gruesome murder," said Rob Berschinski, senior vice president for policy with the advocacy group Human Rights First.</p>
<p>F. Gregory Gause, who heads the international affairs department at Texas A&amp;M University’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, said the critics of Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi’s killing tend&nbsp;to fall into two categories.</p>
<p>One group, he said, are lawmakers "who have always thought that human rights and democracy should play a greater role in our Middle East policy and thus have always been critical of Saudi Arabia." The other are lawmakers "who have been supportive of the relationship with Saudi Arabia for strategic reasons, but find the crown prince’s behavior beyond the pale and want the Trump administration to try to use leverage with Riyadh to isolate, and maybe even remove, the crown prince."</p>
<p><strong>"After the United States, Saudi Arabia is the largest oil producing nation in the world. They have worked closely with us and have been very responsive to my requests to keeping oil prices at reasonable levels — so important for the world."</strong></p>
<p>Trump is correct about Saudi Arabia ranking second in the world in oil production, as this chart shows.</p>
<p>He also has a point that Saudi Arabia has agreed to increase oil production in recent weeks. That commitment came after the news of Khashoggi’s killing, said Anna Mikulska, a fellow at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University’s Baker Institute.</p>
<p>"Following this commitment, the prices of crude started falling," she said. (<a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/26/donald-trump/saudi-arabia-thank-lower-oil-prices-donald-trump-s/">See a related fact-check</a>.)</p>
<p>However, that’s not the only cause of lower oil prices, experts said.</p>
<p>Oil production by the United States has experienced a larger net increase than the entire production increase from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, of which Saudi Arabia is part).</p>
<p>Other countries have also increased their production, including Russia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the demand side, a big reason for the decline is the expectation that the global economy will slow, leaving too much oil and not enough customers, said Paul J. Sullivan, an economics professor in the Eisenhower School at the National Defense University.</p>
<p>In addition, oil is priced in dollars, and the increasing strength of the dollar has made oil cheaper, Sullivan said.</p>
<p>All told, there are "hundreds of other economic factors" that played into oil prices outside of Saudi Arabia, Sullivan said.</p>

<h1 class="hed">An Anti-Vaxxer’s New Crusade</h1>

<p>This story is a collaboration between ProPublica and The New Yorker.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 19, 2016, Melanie Lilliston received an urgent call from the Little Dreamers day care center, in Rockville, Maryland. Her 6-month-old daughter, Millie, was being rushed to the hospital. Doctors there found that Millie had fractured ribs, facial bruises and a severe brain injury. Melanie watched as her daughter was loaded onto a helicopter for emergency transport to Children’s National Medical Center, in Washington, D.C., where doctors discovered more injuries: a fractured leg and arm, as well as bleeding in her eyes. Millie died three days later.</p>
<p>The day care operator, Kia Divband, told police that Millie had started choking while drinking a bottle of milk and lost consciousness. The Montgomery County medical examiner, however, determined that her injuries were caused by blunt force. Investigators discovered, on Divband’s phone and computer, internet searches for “broken bones in children” and “why are bone fractures in children sometimes hard to detect.” A former employer of Divband’s told them that the day before Millie was hospitalized, Divband had called to inquire about a job, and a baby could be heard wailing in the background. Divband told him the baby wouldn’t stop crying and that “he just couldn’t take it anymore,” the former boss recalled. Divband was arrested and charged with fatally abusing Millie.</p>
<p>At Divband's trial, last year, a radiologist named David Ayoub testified for the defense. Ayoub, who is a partner in a private radiology practice in Springfield, Illinois, told jurors he had reviewed X-rays and other medical records, and concluded that Millie had rickets, a rare condition that causes fragile bones. The disorder, which is usually brought on by a prolonged and severe lack of vitamin D, could explain Millie’s injuries, Ayoub said.</p>
<p>Seeking to cast doubt on Ayoub’s credibility, the prosecutor brought up a different issue. Was it true, she asked, that Ayoub believed Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a charity funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to increase vaccination rates in poor countries, was committing genocide? “That’s right,” Ayoub said.</p>
<p>The prosecutor asked if Ayoub believed that Gavi — along with the World Health Organization, the Gates Foundation and UNICEF — were using vaccinations to force sterilization on people in third-world countries. “Yes, that’s my belief,” Ayoub said.</p>
<p>As evidence, he cited a 1972 report of a commission headed by the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller III and a 1974 study overseen by then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, warning about the dangers of population growth. It’s “no leap of faith” to believe that vaccination is being used to carry out this agenda, Ayoub said.</p>
<p>The prosecutor also questioned Ayoub about a speech he delivered in 2005 in which he said his views on vaccination — including his belief that it has contributed to a rise in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/25/seeing-the-spectrum">autism</a> — put him in a “fringe group” and even in the “fringe of that fringe.” Ayoub acknowledged making the statement. “Thinking that vaccines were associated with autism, you’re clearly a minority view if you’re a physician,” Ayoub testified. “If you think it’s done intentionally for nefarious purposes, you’re clearly another level of — you know — different.”</p>
<p>In an email, Ayoub said he did not mean to accuse the alliance or the Gates Foundation of intentional genocide, though he realized that his 2005 lecture might give that impression. “I was concerned by confirmed sporadic reports that some vaccines distributed in third-world countries contained fertility-reducing substances,” he said. “Regardless of whether this was deliberate, careless, unintentional or a cost-cutting measure, I felt that there was a potential for abuse and that this should be investigated.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last decade, Ayoub, who is 59, has become one of the most active expert witnesses in the United States on behalf of accused child abusers. He estimates that he has testified in about 80 child abuse cases in the United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom. He has consulted or written reports in hundreds more.</p>
<p>Prior to his child abuse work, Ayoub was a prominent supporter of a movement that blames the rise in autism — the neurological and developmental disorder that starts in early childhood — on vaccinations that contain mercury, aluminum or other substances. These claims are mostly dismissed by scientists, but they have nonetheless spurred a burgeoning worldwide “anti-vaxxer” movement, which has fueled a decline in vaccination rates. Both positions reflect a deep suspicion of government and mainstream medicine as well as a rising backlash against scientific consensus in an era when misinformation quickly spreads online.</p>
<p>Updates on what our newsroom is covering and uncovering.</p>
<p>Ayoub, in a series of interviews, said his criticism of vaccines is no longer a significant part of his work and has no bearing on his credibility as a witness in child abuse cases. (The Divband trial ultimately ended in a mistrial, after jurors could not agree on a verdict. Prosecutors later retried the case and Divband was convicted on child abuse charges and sentenced to 50 years in prison; Ayoub did not testify in the second trial.) Ayoub said that his testimony in each abuse case is based on a careful review of the medical evidence. He simply wants to see justice done and does not charge for his services as an expert witness, he said. “Parents are being accused and families torn apart based on fractures and/or other boney irregularities that are in fact attributable to bone fragility, not abuse,” he said in an email. If rickets, vitamin D deficiency and other explanations are not addressed, he added, “parents cannot receive fair trials, and families will be destroyed based on a misunderstanding of the radiology and pathology.”</p>
<p>Ayoub, though, doesn’t specialize in treating children. He is not a pediatrician or a pediatric radiologist. Much of his knowledge about rickets in infants comes from reading studies and textbooks, he has said on the stand, rather than formal training. His frequent diagnosis of rickets is questioned by specialists in the field. Peter Strouse, the chief of pediatric radiology at the University of Michigan’s C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, who has served as a prosecution witness in about eight child abuse cases, and consulted in cases where Ayoub was a defense expert, described Ayoub’s views as “a complete fabrication. It’s sad they can get away with that in court.”</p>
<p>Growing up in Peoria, Illinois, Ayoub was a track star who set the state high school record in the 880-yard run in 1977. As an undergraduate at the University of Illinois, he was the Big 10 conference champion in the 1,000-yard run before attending medical school there. Following an interventional radiology fellowship at the University of Iowa, Ayoub returned to Illinois in 1991 and began practicing radiology in Springfield.</p>
<p>Ayoub told me that he became interested in vaccines about 15 years ago after researching treatment for a bothersome knee. He was reading about alternative therapies and ended up subscribing to a newsletter from <a href="https://www.mercola.com/">Joseph Mercola</a>, a proponent of alternative treatments with a large online following and a website that frequently features pieces criticizing vaccination. Mercola has promoted <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/1/5/16041098/dr-joseph-mercola-natural-health-website-bc1ac5e6ebc">other controversial views</a>, including that fluoridated water can give children ADHD. (In 2016, Mercola agreed to pay up to $5.3 million in customer refunds to settle a complaint by federal regulators that he made false claims about the health benefits and safety of tanning beds he sold. Mercola did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>
<p>Opposition to vaccination is almost as old as vaccination itself. But websites like Mercola’s have helped drive the modern anti-vaccination movement. Most scientists consider vaccination one of the greatest public health advances of the 20th century, helping to control or even eradicate diseases such as smallpox, polio and measles in the U.S. Studies have found that vaccines can have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm">side effects</a>, but they are almost always minor, like redness and swelling.</p>
<p>Anti-vaxxers blame vaccines for an increase in rates of autism diagnosed in American children. From 2000 to 2014, the number of children diagnosed with autism-spectrum disorder increased to one in 59 from one in 150. Ayoub and others have argued that vaccines are one reason for this increase, though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that “studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing ASD,” and the World Health Organization issued a similar finding. Prominent anti-vaxxers include celebrities such as the actress Jenny McCarthy and the lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Before becoming president, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> weighed in, tweeting in 2014 that “healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn’t feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!”</p>
<p><a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304567">A study published in September</a> found that Russian trolls and sophisticated Twitter bots tried to foment confusion about vaccination and create a false equivalency between pro- and anti-vaccination arguments. The authors, from George Washington University and other research institutions, warned, “Such strategies may undermine the public health: normalizing these debates may lead the public to question long-standing scientific consensus regarding vaccine efficacy.”</p>
<p>After discovering Mercola’s site, Ayoub said he went down a “rabbit hole” and read thousands of studies and documents about vaccination as he would later about rickets and child abuse. “I was that guy with Birkenstocks mumbling down the hallway,” he told me.</p>
<p>Ayoub found particularly persuasive a 2003 report by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Reform, which said thimerosal, a mercury-based vaccine additive, was “likely related to the autism epidemic” and posed a risk to infants and children. The subcommittee was headed by Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican and later a Tea Party member, who said his own grandson became autistic shortly after being vaccinated. Studies have repeatedly found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Thimerosal was also eliminated from all childhood vaccines in the U.S., except for some flu shots, in the early 2000s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S39kmstBNkk">In a 2005 speech</a> for the Radio Liberty Conference, titled “Mercury, Autism and the Global Vaccine Agenda,” which the prosecutor in the Divband case cited, Ayoub discussed the idea that vaccination could be a cost-effective way to wage “a war on population.” He showed one slide that read, “Syringes cheaper than guns,” and another indicating that the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan totaled $300 billion, while worldwide immunization efforts were initially funded at $1 billion to $2 billion. “So it’s a cheap deal and people don’t run from these bullets,” he said. “They run toward these bullets, so it’s ideal.”</p>
<p>Ayoub flung himself into the anti-vaccination cause. He served as the medical director for two groups alleging safety problems with vaccines; wrote letters to newspapers; lectured at conferences; testified at legislative hearings; and was the registered agent for a political action committee funded by prominent anti-vaxxers. Its mission was to advocate for people with autism “caused by exposure to neurological toxins,” according to a filing.</p>
<p>Mercola interviewed him at least twice for his website. In 2014, Ayoub suggested on Mercola’s site that a desire for high profits drove pharmaceutical companies to promote vaccines and state child welfare agencies to accuse parents of child abuse. “Now, as you know, there’s science that links vaccines with autism,” Ayoub said. “Why isn’t that science believed? Well, it’s attacked. It’s marginalized because there are competing papers, generally very flawed papers, which refute their claims. [They] design studies in order to give the answer that they want. That’s going to happen when you have an industry this strong. The government is a big industry. Child Protection Services is a behemoth, believe me. There’s a lot of money generated from the job of protecting children from abuse.”</p>
<p>David Gorski, a surgical oncologist in Michigan and the managing editor of the online publication Science-Based Medicine, has described Ayoub as an “anti-vaccine loon” and his conspiracy theories as “paranoia.” In an interview, Gorski said he had no idea that Ayoub worked as an expert in child abuse cases. “How on earth is he qualified as an expert?” Gorski asked. “He is looked at as a total joke. It’s disturbing he is effective in this world.”</p>
<p>In 2008, Edward Yazbak, a Massachusetts physician and fellow anti-vaxxer who was also served as a frequent expert witness for accused child abusers, asked Ayoub to look at a case he was consulting on in which the baby had multiple fractures. (Yazbak said he isn’t opposed to vaccination, but “every good thing has bad things.”) Ayoub said the baby, who lived in Florida, had “terrible bones.” He wrote a report to the court and the case was dismissed. Soon Ayoub shifted his target from vaccinations to child abuse allegations.</p>
<p>Besides Yazbak and Ayoub, a handful of prominent vaccination skeptics have served as expert witnesses for child abuse defendants. The Australian hematologist Michael Innis has written that many alleged cases of shaken-baby syndrome — shaking a baby out of anger or frustration — are actually vaccine-related injuries. Innis has written letters to medical journals urging doctors to refuse to vaccinate children and contending that vaccines are associated with autism. (Innis did not respond to a request for comment.) Shaken-baby syndrome has been a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-hardest-cases-when-children-die-justice-can-be-elusive">controversial</a> diagnosis; in some cases, courts have overturned child abuse convictions after medical issues attributed to the syndrome were later found to result from illness or infection.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the pathologist Mohammed Ali Al-Bayati — the author of the 1999 book “Get All the Facts: HIV Does Not Cause AIDS” — has created a business called Toxi-Health International, which provides analysis and expert testimony in child abuse cases that he says are instances of babies hurt by vaccines. Al-Bayati said he does “not have an opinion” on vaccines and simply investigates cases that are brought to him. In some cases, he said, he has determined that a vaccine caused the injuries attributed to child abuse. “I look for all the possible causes and I use functional diagnosis to eliminate all causes based on medical finding not theory,” he said.</p>
<p>Ayoub told me that he sees ulterior motives behind many child abuse allegations. There is a “child abuse industry” that is “part of something very incomprehensible,” he said. He likened it to an organized crime ring, with social workers, doctors and prosecution experts working together to feed foster care systems engaged in a form of “for-profit child trafficking.” He said that state and county child welfare workers have a financial motive to accuse parents of child abuse because federal funding for some programs is determined by the number of cases they handle. Another reason, he said, was pedophilia. “I think there are pedophiles that are child abuse pediatricians. Some of these people are absolutely bizarre.” He added that he had read of several doctors at one prestigious U.S. hospital sexually abusing children. “Can you think of a better place to hide evil than under benevolence?” he said.</p>
<p>Battling the scientific consensus requires “a certain intestinal fortitude,” Ayoub said, because “it is very uncomfortable to go against popular opinion.” He added that it can be dangerous to oppose the child abuse industry. “People have been murdered over this,” he said. “Look up Nancy Schaefer.” Schaefer was a Georgia state legislator who was critical of child protective services there, calling them corrupt. She died in 2010. According to the final investigative summary prepared by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, her husband killed her and then committed suicide. The report states he left several notes confessing to the crime.</p>
<p>In almost all of Ayoub’s hundreds of cases, he has attributed a child’s injuries to a bone disorder. In particular, he believes that a condition known as infantile rickets is often responsible for broken bones and is dramatically underdiagnosed; many doctors fail to even explore the possibility when examining a child. Ayoub asserts that babies with infantile rickets can suffer fractured bones from “everyday handling,” such as a parent bouncing a child on his legs or changing clothes, and the condition can also result in abnormalities that are sometimes misdiagnosed as fractures. (He said he is careful to note in his court testimony that it is possible that children with bone diseases may also be victims of abuse.) Ayoub said that most of his free time is spent studying and investigating rickets. He said the infantile form of the disease starts around 5 weeks of age, peaks around 4 months and is rarely seen in children older than 8 months. It is less obvious on X-rays than rickets in older children, he said.</p>
<p>In 2014, Ayoub co-authored an article in the American Journal of Roentgenology suggesting that a type of fracture commonly associated with child abuse was, in many cases, the result of infantile rickets. Ayoub reached this conclusion after comparing radiographic images of what were classified as fractures from abuse with those of rickets patients from other studies. The journal published three responses from pediatricians and pediatric radiologists, warning that Ayoub’s article could endanger children by mistakenly labeling instances of abuse as bone disease. “Given the stakes involved, we think that the approach of Ayoub et al. is less ‘critical’ than dangerous and that children and families deserve better,” three doctors from children’s hospitals in Boston, Philadelphia and Atlanta wrote in one letter.</p>
<p>Ayoub’s article caught the attention of lawyers for James Duncan, a Floridian who had been convicted, in 1996, of 13 counts of aggravated abuse of his infant son Kody and given a 70-year prison sentence that even prosecutors considered unusually stiff. In 2015, his lawyers filed a motion to reopen the case, arguing that new information, including Ayoub’s article, proved Duncan did not hurt his son. An appeals court last year ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Duncan deserved a new trial. The effort to free Duncan, who has served 22 years in prison, was the subject of an hourlong CNN special this past February. The special included an interview with Ayoub, but did not mention his anti-vaccination views. CNN did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>At the hearing last month, in Clearwater, before Circuit Judge Michael Andrews, Duncan wore an orange prison jumpsuit with a name badge clipped to his chest, and sat at a table with his lawyers. A large group of friends and relatives filled the spectator area behind him. CNN set up three cameras to record the proceedings from multiple angles. As an expert witness for Duncan, Ayoub came across as confident and practiced. Balding with a thin beard with patches of gray, he often turned to talk directly to the judge and used comparisons to everyday items — the ashes at the end of a cigarette, and a shaved carrot — to describe various bone structures.</p>
<p>Ayoub testified that his review of the Duncan case indicated the baby likely had rickets and perhaps other deficiencies that resulted in weak, easy-to-break bones. “I think there is a good alternative explanation for the pattern that we see,” Ayoub told the judge. He speculated that fractures of the baby’s skull, collarbone and ribs may have occurred during birth, when a suction device was used. Ayoub testified that other injuries — fractures of the left arm, shin bone and thigh bone — likely occurred when Kody was being vaccinated. “All those date back to the doctor’s office visit,” he said. “Restrained child and what would normally be an innocuous event where you expect a child to fight and could be held down.”</p>
<p>Andrews was skeptical. “Did I hear that an immobile infant, a child who is 2 months or less, has to be held down to be able to be immunized?” he asked. Duncan’s lawyer, Lisabeth Fryer, responded that when an infant is given a vaccination shot, “there’s a reflex, with my children anyway, that required support. ... There wasn’t just a splayed-out child patiently waiting.“</p>
<p>Kody Duncan, who is now 25 years old and a tennis coach at a Pennsylvania college, testified in defense of his father. Kody said that he did not believe that James Duncan abused him. He said the two talk by phone every week.</p>
<p>The state’s two expert witnesses, including the doctor who had evaluated Kody’s injuries at All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, testified that the medical evidence of abuse was clear and the baby did not have rickets. After being separated from his father, Kody suffered no further fractures, exposing a potential weakness in Ayoub’s analysis: How could a baby who suffered more than a dozen fractures from his head to his leg owing to dangerously weak bones not have a single accidental break in the ensuing weeks, months and years?</p>
<p>Ayoub offered several possible explanations. He said the foster parents who cared for Kody Duncan were likely more careful with him because they were told he had been injured; that it was possible Kody suffered more fractures, but they were not symptomatic and went undetected, or that his vitamin D levels rose significantly, which Ayoub said is natural among children at that age, and his bones strengthened. “So there is a window of fragility there,” Ayoub said.</p>
<p>Shortly after starting to cross-examine Ayoub, the state prosecutor Paul Bolan asked him: “You also have some other opinions that are not in mainstream medical view as well, correct? You believe vaccines are related to autism, correct?” Ayoub never had to answer. Duncan’s attorney immediately objected to the questioning. She argued that the inquiry was “impeachment on a collateral issue.” Andrews, who is expected to rule soon on whether Duncan deserves a new trial, agreed that Ayoub’s views on vaccination were irrelevant.</p>
<p>Other judges have also blocked prosecutors from asking Ayoub about his beliefs regarding vaccination. When Ayoub testified last year in a Massachusetts state court on behalf of a father accused of murdering his 5-month-old son, the prosecutor asked Ayoub if vaccines and autism were something he worked extensively on. The defense objected, and the judge ordered the lawyers to a sidebar where jurors could not hear them. The judge wanted to know why she should allow the prosecutor to continue asking about Ayoub’s vaccination work, according to a trial transcript. The prosecutor said Ayoub had lectured extensively on “the link between vaccines and autism in an area that he really had no training or expertise in. And the Commonwealth is seeking to show that he flits from subject to subject. He was an autism-vaccine guy and now he’s the metabolic-bone-disease guy.” The judge instructed the prosecutor to drop the subject.</p>
<p>Ayoub went on to testify in the case that ordinary handling of a child with a “severe bone-fragility disorder,” namely rickets, could have caused the fractures. The jury sided with Ayoub over the prosecution’s medical expert, Paul Kleinman, a pediatric radiologist who has produced much of the mainstream research on fractures and child abuse, and acquitted the father of assault and battery related to the fractures. A mistrial was declared on a murder charge.</p>
<p>In response to questions about Ayoub, Jeffrey Brown, the defense attorney in the case, said in an email that he had not been worried about Ayoub’s vaccination beliefs hurting his credibility on the stand. “It was not relevant,” he wrote. “Dr. Ayoub was a very effective and helpful witness.” Brown said he agrees with Ayoub that bone disorders are frequently misdiagnosed as abuse. “It is plain as day to me that the child abuse pediatrician establishment has gotten it wrong. ... Those who try to trash him and his colleagues are scared of the consequences of being exposed.”</p>
<p>Ayoub’s zealousness in disputing child abuse allegations <a href="http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed187538">troubled a judge</a> last year in the United Kingdom. In upholding a local agency’s determination that a 5-month-old baby with 26 fractures was abused, Judge Peter Jackson of the Royal Courts of Justice wrote that Ayoub’s testimony was “shot through with the dogma that child abuse is over-diagnosed” and didn’t meet the legal standard for objectivity. “Having taken up a position, he advanced it with the tenacity of an advocate and was dismissive of alternative possibilities,” the judge wrote. “He entertained no doubts about the correctness of his opinion, a dangerous mindset for any expert witness.”</p>

<p class="series-description">Inside New York’s Deadly Private Garbage Industry</p>
<p>Sanitation Salvage, the embattled private trash hauler recently suspended from operations by New York City regulators, has decided to surrender its operating license.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to city regulators Tuesday, lawyers for Sanitation Salvage said the company would cease operations “forthwith.”</p>
<p>Officials at the Business Integrity Commission, or BIC, the city agency charged with overseeing the private trash industry, did not have an immediate public response. The BIC this year declared the company, one of the largest in the city, a threat to the public after two fatal crashes and a rash of safety violations documented by the agency’s investigators. The company returned to operations in October, but it remained under investigation and was required to agree to the installation of a monitor to oversee its daily operations.</p>
<p>Emails sent to the owners of Sanitation Salvage and their lawyers were not immediately answered. The company has steadfastly defended its performance, saying it placed the safety of its workers and the public first. When the city suspended Sanitation Salvage’s operation in August, lawyers for the company said the action was misguided and unlawful.</p>
<p>In the letter to the city, lawyers for the company again complained about the city’s action and said the company’s decision to surrender its license was a result of the suspension.</p>
<p>“As we repeatedly warned, BIC’s unlawful and ill-advised decision to suspend Sanitation Salvage’s license on August 24, 2018, without any prior notice or opportunity to be heard, has doomed the Company as a viable going concern,” the lawyers wrote. The lawyers added that Sanitation Salvage had been left “with no choice but to surrender its license rather than incur further operating losses.”</p>
<p>The letter suggests that the company was looking to sell prior to Tuesday’s developments. Indeed, one person familiar with Sanitation Salvage’s plans told ProPublica this week that the company had had initial talks with at least one prospective buyer</p>
<p>Get ProPublica’s Daily&nbsp;Digest.</p>
<p>The prospect of Sanitation Salvage being sold had alarmed the City Council member who chairs the Sanitation Committee, as well as a number of advocates pushing for broad reform of the private trash industry. The company, which is based in the Bronx, had been found liable by the federal Department of Labor for hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid wages to its workers. Advocates wanted to make sure the company couldn’t sell to avoid paying.</p>
<p>It was unclear Tuesday what will become of the city’s investigation of the company, and whether it might still be able to depose employees and perhaps issue fines. Any sale of the company would have been subject to conditions imposed by the BIC. City law does not place limits on the conditions that the agency can set. Past sales of some companies have been contingent on owners agreeing to lifetime bans from the industry.</p>
<p>In recent months, ProPublica has reported on Sanitation Salvage’s troubled record of labor and safety violations, including involvement of its workers in two deaths. ProPublica and Voice of America <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/treated-like-trash">revealed</a>&nbsp;that Sanitation Salvage workers lied to the authorities about one of the fatal crashes, which resulted in the death of a 21-year-old off-the-books worker in November 2017. The two company employees on the truck that ran over the worker, an African immigrant named Mouctar Diallo, told the police that the dead man was an unknown homeless man who had jumped aboard the truck. In April, the same driver was involved in a second crash in which 72-year-old Leo Clarke was killed while crossing the street.</p>
<p>The BIC ultimately barred the driver from working in the industry.</p>
<p>Current and former workers of Sanitation Salvage also complained about dangerous job conditions, with drivers and other employees working shifts as long as 18 or even 21 hours. Extra workers were often hired off the street at a rate of $80 per shift.</p>
<p>In 2015, after an investigation, the federal Department of Labor concluded that Sanitation Salvage owed workers $385,000 in unpaid overtime accumulated over the previous three years. Workers said the company <a href="https://features.propublica.org/sanitation-salvage/sanitation-salvage-accidents-new-york-city-commercial-carting-garbage/">installed</a>&nbsp;what they called a sham union that served the interests of Sanitation Salvage’s owners. Records show the union was long run by mobster James Bernardone, identified by law enforcement as a soldier in the Genovese crime family. In 2013, the National Labor Relations Board <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/02-RC-070804">found</a>&nbsp;that Sanitation Salvage’s management unlawfully threatened to fire workers who opposed the union.</p>
<p>The BIC eventually <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/sanitation-salvage-ordered-to-halt-trash-collections">suspended</a>&nbsp;Sanitation Salvage’s license, saying the company posed “an imminent danger to life and property.” The agency cataloged an array of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/at-hearing-for-sanitation-salvage-more-questions-about-safety-and-oversight">violations</a>&nbsp;including undisclosed workers, unlicensed drivers, a majority of drivers pulling long shifts far exceeding federal regulations and 58 collisions over the last three years.</p>
<p>“This company has demonstrated time and time again that they value profit over the lives of New Yorkers and the well-being of their workers,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement at the time of the suspension in August.</p>
<p>Sanitation Salvage has not responded to detailed questions over many months. Sanitation Salvage said the claims of unpaid overtime were without merit, according to a Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division investigator’s report. The company refused to pay the $385,000, claiming the workers were seeking to be paid for time actually spent hanging out with friends. When the department chose not to take the company to court, the issue ended.</p>
<p>The union that represents Sanitation Salvage’s workers has not responded to requests for comment about its history with the company or the findings of the Department of Labor or the NLRB.</p>
<p>One person with knowledge of Sanitation Salvage’s recent operations said the company had lost as many as half of its customers after the suspension this fall. And just this week, the city’s public housing agency said it was moving to cancel contracts it had with the company.</p>
<p>Natalie Grybauskas, a spokesperson for the BIC, said in a short statement Tuesday night that the agency had received the letter from Sanitation Salvage and was working to make sure the company’s customers got their trash collected.</p>

<h1 class="hed">Elkhart, Indiana, Police Chief Suspended for 30 Days Following Release of Beating Video</h1>

<p class="series-description">Justice in an Indiana County</p>
<p>This article was produced in partnership with the <a href="https://www.southbendtribune.com/">South Bend Tribune</a>, a member of ProPublica’s <a href="https://www.propublica.org/local-reporting-network/">Local Reporting Network</a>.</p>
<p>For the last two weeks, the police chief in Elkhart, Indiana, has been a no-show at various forums where he might have been expected to appear, from civilian oversight board hearings to town hall meetings focusing on the city’s Police Department.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Mayor Tim Neese confirmed what others had been left to wonder: He had suspended the police chief, Ed Windbigler, placing him on a 30-day unpaid leave. The suspension started Nov. 14, but Neese had made no public announcement. A South Bend Tribune reporter had left repeated messages at City Hall on Monday, asking about the police chief’s status.</p>
<p>Instead of returning the reporter’s messages, <a href="https://www.wndu.com/content/news/Elkhart-police-chief-serving-30-day-suspension--501326911.html">Neese went on television Tuesday morning</a> and mentioned, in passing, that the department’s second in command was now serving as interim chief. The television station, WNDU, then reported Windbigler’s suspension for the first time.</p>
<p>The suspension comes after the Tribune, working with ProPublica, obtained a video of two Elkhart police officers punching a handcuffed man in the face. Initially, the officers only received reprimands from Windbigler rather than more serious punishment. After the news organizations requested the video, the officers were charged with misdemeanor battery.</p>
<p>In an email late Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Neese said the mayor had two reasons for Windbigler’s suspension: “failure to promptly notify” the mayor of the beating, and “understating the severity of the incident” to the Police Merit Commission, a civilian oversight board. Windbigler, in June, told the commission that the two officers had gone “a little overboard” when taking the man to the ground, with no mention of the punches thrown.</p>
<p>Separately, ProPublica and the Tribune also have disclosed that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nearly-all-officers-in-charge-of-elkhart-indiana-police-department-have-been-disciplined">28 of the department’s 34 supervisors have disciplinary records</a>. Fifteen have prior suspensions, including the chief, assistant chief and patrol captain.</p>
<p>Get ProPublica’s Daily&nbsp;Digest.</p>
<p>At a Nov. 14 town hall meeting, Neese said he disciplined Windbigler for his handling of the officers who punched the handcuffed man. But he did not elaborate or specify what the discipline was.</p>
<p>Jim Rieckhoff, chair of Elkhart’s Police Merit Commission, was unaware as recently as Monday that Windbigler had been suspended. Rieckhoff told a reporter that he did wonder about the absence of the chief at a meeting on Monday, at which the chief’s top assistant appeared in Windbigler’s stead.</p>
<p>Neese has said in “hindsight” that Windbigler should have issued more severe discipline than reprimands to officers Cory Newland and Joshua Titus, who were videotaped punching the handcuffed man Jan. 12 in the police station’s detention area. The mayor’s son, Sgt. Drew Neese, was in the room while the officers punched the man. He walked over and spoke into his radio as the beating ended. Newland, Titus and Drew Neese have not responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Windbigler did not respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday, and attempts to reach him by phone were unsuccessful. An email to his work address generated an automated reply, saying, “I am currently out of the office, I will return Monday December 17, 2018.”</p>
<p>Neese also told WNDU on Tuesday that he has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the city’s Police Department, though he did not elaborate on what exactly he wants investigated. A Tribune reporter’s messages to the mayor’s office, seeking details, went unanswered Tuesday.</p>
<p>This month, Neese asked the Indiana State Police to conduct a “complete investigation” of the city’s Police Department, but <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/indiana-state-police-turn-down-elkhart-mayors-request-for-broad-review-of-citys-police-department">last week the state police declined</a>. The review was more suited to the DOJ, the state police said.</p>
<p>The Police Department’s assistant chief, Todd Thayer, is now running the department. He appeared at an Elkhart Board of Public Safety meeting Tuesday morning, when the board approved paid administrative leave for Newland and Titus. Their leave status could change to unpaid, though, after their initial court appearance on Dec. 3 on the battery charge, the assistant chief said.</p>
<p>At its meeting, the Board of Public Safety postponed approval of a new board to review each use of force by the department and to monitor patterns of excessive force. The mayor announced the creation of the board this month, after details of the Jan. 12 beating were published.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the review board would be made up of five members — and all five would be police officers, including the assistant chief, a captain, an internal affairs investigator and instructors in the use of force and defensive tactics.</p>
<p>Board president Robert Woods asked Thayer to add language to the proposal specifying that civilian members of the city’s Police Merit Commission would work closely with the new review board. The Board of Public Safety voted 3-1 to postpone approval until that language could be added.</p>
<p>Board member Jean Mayes said the board should only have civilians and no officers.</p>
<p>“Police cannot police themselves, and that’s obvious from what’s happened,” Mayes said.</p>
<p>Thayer said civilians would not understand the decision-making behind police uses of force.</p>

<p class="series-description">Trump’s Immigration Policy at the Border</p>
<p>It was shortly before Thanksgiving in an immigration court in San Antonio, and the third defendant to come before Judge Anibal Martinez walked into the courtroom without an attorney, wearing a gray winter hat that was stitched with a pair of blue googly eyes and a floppy red yarn mohawk.</p>
<p>When the bailiff asked his name, he piped up proudly: Wilder Hilario Maldonado Cabrera.</p>
<p>“How old is Wilder?” the immigration judge asked.</p>
<p>An attorney, who was there with other clients, came forward and volunteered to stand in for Wilder. She turned to the boy and in Spanish asked his age.</p>
<p>“Seis años,” he said, 6, his legs dangling from a chair at the defendant’s table.</p>
<p>Wilder, a smiley, pudgy Salvadoran boy, missing his two front teeth, was the youngest defendant on the juvenile docket that day. But that wasn’t all that made him special. He was one of the last children left in government custody who had been affected by the administration’s widely criticized zero-tolerance policy, and who were still awaiting reunification with parents detained in the United States.</p>
<p>The policy, which was announced with great fanfare in April and was scuttled two months later in the face of bipartisan opposition, required immigration authorities to file criminal charges against anyone caught crossing the border illegally and separate them from the children they brought with them.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://propub.li/2DKyd1Y">Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter</a> to receive articles and investigations like this one as soon as they’re published.</em></p>
<p>Over 2,600 immigrant children — including more than 100 who were under the age of 5 — were separated from their parents before a federal judge ordered the administration to end the policy and reunite the families affected. Most have been reunited with parents or other relatives. Around 120 children remain in federal custody because their parents had already been deported. Some 30 cases involve children whose parents have criminal histories. As immigration authorities and advocates scrambled to put the broken families back together, courtrooms like Martinez’s often felt more like family court.</p>
<p>Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.</p>
<p>On the day that Wilder appeared, the courtroom was full of minors, most of them teenagers who had not been separated from parents at the border but had migrated to the United States on their own. The boys, wearing pressed slacks and button-down shirts, sat in the back. And there were three very pregnant girls, one of them complaining of pain, in the front.</p>
<p>“I hear we have a child with medical issues?” Martinez said, peering down at her from his dais. “If she’s not comfortable or if she needs to step outside at all, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>One of the first children to be summoned before Martinez was an 11-year-old Guatemalan girl, wearing a flowered dress with her hair tied in a ponytail high on her head.</p>
<p>She sat in a black leather chair and barely said a word, as her attorney, Monica Cueva Kretzschmar, explained that she had admitted to illegally crossing the border and wanted to be sent home to Guatemala to her parents (hers was not a family separation case). The judge asked whether the girl had made the decision of her own free will. She had, the lawyer said. Did her return pose any risks of harm or danger, he asked? The lawyer said no.</p>
<p>Then the judge looked at the girl. “I understand you want to return to your parents in Guatemala,” he said. She nodded back. “I just granted that request. I wish you all the best.”</p>
<p>The girl got up from her seat, grinning and waving a thumbs-up at the attorneys in the audience.</p>
<p>Then it was Wilder’s turn.</p>
<p>The judge asked about the boy’s father. Was he still detained?</p>
<p>The prosecutor said he didn’t know.</p>
<p>He was, in fact, still in federal custody at an immigration detention facility less than an hour’s drive away from the court. The boy and his father had been separated on June 6, after they illegally crossed the border and asked for asylum. Wilder was placed into temporary foster care. His father, Hilario Maldonado, was sent to detention. They’d only sporadically been able to speak on the telephone ever since.</p>
<p>Authorities had determined soon after Maldonado entered the country that he did not qualify for asylum, but they refused to reunite him with his son while that decision was appealed because Maldonado, who lived in the United States more than a decade ago, had an old warrant for a DUI in Florida. It’s a charge that would almost never result in a loss of parental custody in a non-immigration context, but immigration lawyers say they have seen immigration authorities use such minor, nonviolent criminal records to justify separating immigrant parents from their children at the border. Government officials say that while a federal court ordered them to stop separating children under zero tolerance, it exempted cases involving parents who posed security risks to their child.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wilder’s mother, Maria Elida Cabrera, was still back in El Salvador, struggling for the first time to feed Wilder’s three siblings on her own. She said by phone that Maldonado was the family breadwinner, and since his detention she and her children were surviving with help from immigrant advocacy groups in the United States who’d heard about Wilder’s case.</p>
<p>None of them knew when and if they’d be together again — least of all little Wilder. Born in a remote mountain village at the northern edge of El Salvador, he barely knew what to make of the metal detector at the courthouse, much less why he was in court in the first place.</p>
<p>Before entering the courtroom, the bailiff had to gently nudge the boy through the machine, because he froze in fright at the blinking lights on its side. “No seas nervioso,” she told him, don’t be nervous.</p>
<p>The attorney helped Wilder put on his headphones, so he could hear the court translator, as if language was the only barrier to his ability to follow the whirlwind proceedings.</p>
<p>Then she asked the judge to set aside any decisions about the boy’s asylum claim until Wilder’s lawyer could arrange to be in court with him. The judge agreed.</p>
<p>“Wilder, I wish you well,” he said, sending the boy off to uncertainty. “We’ll see you soon.”</p>
<p>Wilder, a huge Spider-Man fan, waved at the judge, then pretended he was shooting spiderwebs from his wrists. On his way out, he waved to the friendly bailiff and said, “Bye policía.”</p>

<p class="series-description">Trump’s Immigration Policy at the Border</p>
<p>The Trump administration has quietly resumed separating immigrant families at the border, in some cases using vague or unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoing or minor violations against the parents, including charges of illegally re-entering the country, as justification.</p>
<p>Over the last three months, lawyers at Catholic Charities, which provides legal services to immigrant children in government custody in New York, have discovered at least 16 new separation cases. They say they have come across such instances by chance and via their own sleuthing after children were put into temporary foster care and shelters with little or no indication that they arrived at the border with their parents.</p>
<p>ProPublica stumbled upon one more case late last month after receiving a call from a distraught Salvadoran father who had been detained in South Texas, and whose 4-year-old son, Brayan, had literally been yanked from his grasp by a Customs and Border Protection agent after they crossed the border and asked for asylum. Julio, the father, asked to be identified only by his first name because he was fleeing gang violence and worried about the safety of relatives back home.</p>
<p>“I failed him,” said Julio, 27, sobbing uncontrollably. “Everything I had done to be a good father was destroyed in an instant.”</p>

<p>ProPublica tracked down Brayan, who has reddish-blond hair and an endearing lisp, at a temporary foster care agency in New York City, and reached out to the lawyer who represents him. Until that phone call, the lawyer, Jodi Ziesemer, a supervising attorney at Catholic Charities, had no idea that Brayan had been separated from his father. The chaos, she said, felt disturbingly like zero tolerance all over again.</p>
<p>“It’s so disheartening,” Ziesemer said “This was supposed to be a policy that ended.”</p>

<p>Officially it has. On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order retreating from his so-called zero-tolerance immigration enforcement policy, which called on authorities to criminally prosecute adults caught illegally crossing the border and separate them from any children they brought with them. A week later, a federal judge, Dana M. Sabraw, issued an injunction against the separations and ordered the government to put the thousands of affected families back together.</p>
<p>Sabraw, however, exempted cases in which the safety of the child was at risk, and crucially, imposed no standards or oversight over those decisions. As a result, attorneys say, immigration officials — taking their cues from an administration that has made it clear it still believes family separations are an effective deterrent — are using whatever justification they can find, with or without substantiation, to deem immigrant parents unfit or unsafe.</p>
<p>“If the authorities have even the most specious evidence that a parent was a gang member, or had some kind of blemish on their record,” said Neha Desai, a senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law, “anything they can come up with to say that the separation is for the health and welfare of the child, then they’ll separate them.”</p>
<p>In an email, a senior CBP official acknowledged that immigrant families are still being separated, but said the separations had “nothing to do with zero tolerance.” The official added that “this administration continues to comply with the law and separates adults and children when required for the safety and security of the child.” The official declined to say how many children have been taken from their parents for what was said to be their own protection.</p>
<p>CBP officials explained that Brayan was such a case. One official said that the agency had conducted a routine background check on Julio, and that it “confirmed his gang affiliation with MS-13.” Spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer declined to provide the evidence the agency had to support the allegation, saying only that it was “law enforcement sensitive.” Nor would she say why CBP believed Julio was a danger to his child. But Sabraw’s order, she said, “did not prevent these separations, in fact it explicitly allows DHS to continue with this prior practice.”</p>
<p>CBP has also not shared any evidence supporting its assertion of Julio’s gang ties with his lawyer, Georgia Evangelista, who said she wonders whether it exists.</p>
<p>(On Tuesday, a government lawyer repeated the allegation to an immigration judge in South Texas but said he could not provide documentation to the court because it was “confidential,” according to Evangelista. She said the immigration judge did not press for release of the evidence but freed her client on an $8,000 bond. Evangelista was frustrated by the outcome, saying, “How can we fight these charges when we don’t know what they are.”)</p>
<p>According to Evangelista, Julio arrived at the border in mid-September, carrying a letter prepared by a Salvadoran lawyer that explained that he had fled El Salvador with his son because he had been attacked and threatened by gangs there for years. At Evangelista’s request, the Salvadoran lawyer and Julio’s former employer sent sworn statements vouching for Julio’s character, and stating that he was never involved in criminal activity.</p>
<p>“I’m furious about this. They aren’t playing by the rules,” Evangelista said, referring to U.S. immigration authorities. “They’re treating him like a criminal so they can justify taking away his son. Where’s the proof? It’s his word against theirs. It sickens me.”</p>
<p>Susan Watson, a civil rights and family lawyer, said this kind of action could not be done without a judge’s review in custody cases that do not involve immigration issues. “Constitutionally, before a parent is separated from a child, you are entitled to due process,” she said. “Some decision in a dark corner by the Border Patrol doesn’t meet that standard.”</p>
<p>In New York, Ziesemer says the new separations identified by her organization involve children between the ages of 2 and 17, including Brayan. All of them arrived in New York City without any records indicating they had been separated from their parents at the border and why. A few weeks ago, the ACLU, which brought the lawsuit over the first round of family separations, sent a letter to the Justice Department raising concerns about the new cases, specifically about the grounds for the separations and why the ACLU hadn’t been notified about them.</p>
<p>Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who led the organization’s lawsuit against family separations in the spring, said, “If the government is still secretly separating children, and is doing so based on flimsy excuses, that would be patently unconstitutional and we will be back in court.”</p>
<p>Lawyers at the ACLU and Catholic Charities said that the DOJ responded that it wasn’t obligated to report the new separations to the ACLU because they hadn’t been done as a part of the zero-tolerance policy. The DOJ said that in 14 of the 17 cases flagged in the ACLU’s letter, the children were removed from their parents’ custody because authorities suspected the parents had some kind of criminal background that made them unfit — even dangerous. But the agency would not specify what crimes the parents were suspected of committing and what evidence authorities had to support these allegations.</p>
<p>The ACLU and other groups representing immigrant children said the DOJ’s secrecy is highly troubling on several counts. They worry that the Department of Homeland Security has allowed authorities without formal training in custody issues — primarily Border Patrol agents — to make decisions using standards that could violate the spirit of the court order and that would never hold up in non-immigration cases. Ziesemer has talked to relatives and social workers and says she suspects that at least eight of the cases involve parents whose crime is illegally re-entering the country. Illegal re-entry is a felony, although previous administrations did not typically separate families in such cases. Ziesemer said the allegations the government has advanced to justify separations in eight other cases were either vague or unsubstantiated. The final case she identified involved a parent who was hospitalized.</p>
<p>“The government’s position is that because these are not zero-tolerance cases, they don’t have to tell us, or anyone, about them,” Ziesemer said. “Our position is that when children are separated from their parents, there needs to be some oversight.”</p>
<p>Brayan’s case is a vivid example of how government officials are interpreting the court order to allow separations of families.</p>
<p>I found out about him by accident. Early last month, after the government reported that of the more than 2,600 immigrant children separated under the zero-tolerance policy, only one child under the age of 5 remained in their care. I decided to try to find that child, thinking the case might make a compelling bookend to a story I’d written this year about a girl named <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-trump-immigration-policy">Alison Jimena Valencia Madrid,</a> whose cries were recorded inside a Border Patrol detention facility in June. The recording ignited a storm of outrage that tipped the political scales against the Trump administration’s family separation policy.</p>
<p>An attorney on the border, Thelma O. Garcia, said she represented a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/6-year-old-in-immigration-court-by-himself-zero-tolerance-family-separation">6-year-old Salvadoran boy named Wilder Hilario Maldonado Cabrera</a>, who was in a temporary foster home in San Antonio. Wilder had been separated from his father in June, Garcia said, and hadn’t been reunited because the father had a 10-year-old warrant for a DUI charge in Florida.</p>
<p>The father, Hilario Maldonado, called me from the South Texas detention facility in Pearsall and said he’d tried to keep in touch with Wilder by phone, but his social worker didn’t always pick up. When they did connect, he said, Wilder, pudgy, precocious and missing his two front teeth, scolded him for not coming to take him home.</p>
<p>I told Maldonado that it appeared he would be one of the last parents to go through such a separation because the government had agreed to stop them.</p>
<p>Maldonado, 39, said that wasn’t true. The separations are still happening, he said, and he knew of one.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I got a call from Julio, who was at the same detention facility. He sounded desperate, crying and pleading for answers. He said he’d turned himself and Brayan into the authorities as soon as they’d crossed the border, asked for asylum and told immigration agents that his mother, who lives in Austin, Texas, was willing to help him get on his feet. Seven days later, a Border Patrol agent took Brayan, dressed in a SpongeBob SquarePants T-shirt, away, screaming.</p>
<p>Julio said all he knew was that his son was somewhere in New York. As soon as we hung up, I called Ziesemer at Catholic Charities, which has a government contract to provide legal services to the unaccompanied minors in the city. I asked whether she’d heard of Brayan.</p>
<p>“We do know this kid,” Ziesemer quickly responded, “but were not aware he was separated from his father.”</p>
<p>Ziesemer was audibly shaken. “Until you called, all I had was his name on a spreadsheet,” she said.</p>
<p>Ziesemer immediately arranged to have Brayan, who had been placed in a temporary foster home, brought to her office. Her experience told her not to expect much from their first interaction, partly because Brayan was likely to be afraid, and partly because he was only 4. So she tried putting Brayan at ease by opening a box of crayons and a Spider-Man coloring book.</p>
<p>He warmed up to her quickly, putting down his crayons to show her his Spider-Man moves and squiggling lines on a piece of paper when she asked whether he knew how to write his name. But, as Ziesemer expected, he was too young to make sense of what had happened to him on the border, much less explain it to an adult he’d just met. And his lisp made it hard for Ziesemer to understand the few things he could tell her.</p>
<p>After the meeting, she sounded both exasperated about having to grill a tiny child and terrified that there might be other children like him buried in her spreadsheets.</p>
<p>“We, and the caseworkers and the consulates, do what we can to fill in the gaps and figure out where these kids came from,” she said. “But that means days and weeks go by with a child not knowing where his parents are and vice versa. And it doesn’t have to be that way. It shouldn’t be that way.”</p>
<p>After Ziesemer’s meeting with Brayan, I traveled to Pearsall to meet Julio. He said he’d fled the country with Brayan because street gangs had threatened to kill him after finding out that he reported one of their members to the police. His wife and stepson stayed behind because there wasn’t enough money to pay for everyone to come. I spoke to his wife, who told me she was hiding out at her parents’ house because she didn’t want to be home if gang members came looking for her husband.</p>
<p>In photos his relatives sent, Julio looked sort of like a cop, stocky with a crew cut. But after a month in detention, he looked pale and deflated. He wore navy blue detention garb and his dark brown hair was wet, though neatly combed. He didn’t have any tattoos, which are common among Central American gang members.</p>
<p>Through tears, Julio told me he’d replayed the days since his arrival at the border in his mind, trying to make sense of why authorities took away his son. Julio and Brayan had been taken to the “ice box,” a notorious air-conditioned cellblock that is the first stop for most immigrants intercepted at the border. Brayan developed a high fever and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment. A Border Patrol agent who drove Julio and his son scolded Julio for bringing a small boy on such a harrowing trip. Could that be the reason they took his son away? Was it because the agents had looked at the color of Brayan’s hair and didn’t believe he was the boy’s father?</p>
<p>Julio wonders whether he had been fooled into signing a document at the hospital — they were all in English — surrendering his rights to his child. Was it because he’d once been arrested for a robbery in El Salvador, but exonerated two days later when authorities realized they had the wrong person? Why would they consider him a danger to his child?</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I told him that Julio learned his child had been taken from him because Border Patrol agents suspected he was a gang member. The news hit him hard, and it was confounding because at the same time the CBP had deemed him a gang member, another agency within DHS had found that his asylum petition, in which Julio claims he was a victim of gang violence, was persuasive enough to be heard by an immigration judge.</p>
<p>In early October, Julio had met with an asylum officer for what’s known as a credible fear interview. According to the report of that interview, which Julio provided to ProPublica, the asylum officer not only asked him why he fled El Salvador, but whether he had a criminal record. Among the questions were: Have you ever committed a crime in any country? Have you ever harmed someone for any reason? Even if you did not want to, have you ever helped someone else harm people? Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime? Have you ever been a member of a gang?</p>
<p>Julio answered no to all of them. The asylum officer who conducted the interview deemed Julio’s account credible, and, even more significantly, indicated that she had been provided no derogatory information or criminal records that would automatically bar Julio from winning asylum.</p>
<p>The discrepancy reflects differences in the legal standards for asylum and family separation. While the asylum officer’s decision is subject to review by a judge, the Border Patrol’s decision to take away Julio’s child was not.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what information, if any, they really have on Julio,” his attorney, Evangelista, said. “They have total discretion when it comes to separating him from his child. They can do what they want. And they don’t have to explain why.”</p>
<p>Julio said his own father had abandoned him when he was about Brayan’s age. Then his mother left for the United States when he was 7. He said he vowed never to do the same thing to Brayan, which is why he didn’t leave the boy behind in El Salvador. He wonders now whether that was a mistake. In every phone call with Brayan, Julio says, he feels his son slowly slipping away.</p>
<p>“He tells me: ‘You’re not my Papa anymore. I have a new Papa,’” Julio said of his son, adding: “He doesn’t even call me Papa. He calls me Papi. I never taught him that word.”</p>
<p>Back in New York, Ziesemer said she worries family separations may be beginning all over again.</p>
<p>Sitting with Brayan in her office, she said, brought back the faces of the 400 or so separated kids who had shuffled through over the summer. As Catholic Charities’ point person during the crisis, she said she came to know every single one of those kids by name. One 9-year-old girl went into a full panic attack when she was asked to step into a room without her sister because she thought Ziesemer was going to take her sister away like officials had taken her mother. “At one point, we had to have a meeting with the entire office to explain why the conference room was full of all these wailing kids,” she said.</p>
<p>Catholic Charities, the ACLU and several other large immigrant advocacy groups took the lead in putting the families together again; working the phones to find parents who were still in immigration detention and dispatching colleagues to Central America to track down parents who had already been deported. In addition to the “huge, heavy lift” of reunification, Ziesemer said, there was a crush of calls and emails from Congress, consulates and the media — all seeking information about the separations.</p>
<p>Ziesemer said she and her team worked around the clock for months, and though there are still several dozen kids awaiting reunification, she thought things were winding down. That’s when she began seeing new cases, like Brayan’s, which had some of the same hallmarks of the old ones.</p>
<p>Ziesemer didn’t know much about Brayan, except the little bit of information she’d gotten from him during their meeting. So I shared with her some of the things I’d learned about him from his family: that he could eat four hard-boiled eggs in one sitting; that he loved Lightning McQueen, a character from the Pixar movie “Cars”; and that he had a dog, Lucky, whom he insisted on seeing during every WhatsApp video call with his mother. His grandmother in Austin had fixed up a bedroom for him, filled with Mickey Mouse dolls, remote-control cars and winter coats. I told Ziesemer how distraught Brayan’s father was that his son called him “Papi.”</p>
<p>“A couple of weeks is a long time for a kid his age,” she said about Brayan. “They start losing attachments to people, even their parents.”</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Trump’s Border Claims</h1>
an
the
<p>After a group of migrants tried to breach the U.S. border at Tijuana, with some throwing rocks and border agents responding with tear gas,&nbsp;Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said there were no “reported serious injuries on either side of the border.” But President Donald Trump told reporters the same day that “three Border Patrol people yesterday were very badly hurt through getting hit with rocks and stones.”</p>
<p>We asked the White House and the Department of Homeland Security about the president’s claim, but we have not received a response.</p>
<p>The conflict occurred at the San&nbsp;Ysidro Port of Entry, the major border crossing between Tijuana and San Diego. There are more than 5,600 Central American migrants, who had traveled in caravans through Mexico, housed in a Tijuana sports complex, according to the director of Mexico’s&nbsp;Social Development Secretariat, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/us/san-ysidro-port-of-entry-migrant-arrests/index.html">reports</a>. Tijuana Mayor <span>Juan Manuel Gastelum&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.kbtx.com/content/news/Tijuana-mayor-declares-humanitarian-crisis-over-migrants-501181662.html">has declared</a> a humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>On Nov. 25, when planned protests in Mexico reached the border, some migrants attempted to cross into the U.S. at the port of entry and then tried to enter through fencing along the border, according to&nbsp;<span>U.S. Customs and Border Protection.&nbsp;</span>The port of entry was <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-temporarily-suspends-operations-san-ysidro-port-entry">closed temporarily</a> and the incident involved&nbsp;“<span>over 1,000 individuals who sought to enter the U.S. unlawfully in large groups,” <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/statement-commissioner-mcaleenan-incident-san-ysidro-yesterday">McAleenan, the CBP commissioner, said</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>McAleenan&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/statement-commissioner-mcaleenan-incident-san-ysidro-yesterday">told</a> reporters on Nov. 26 that some of those individuals threw rocks or other projectiles at U.S. border personnel but that no one was seriously hurt. “Four agents were hit with rocks, but were wearing protective gear and did not suffer serious injuries,” he said. A White House blog post <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600daily/">repeated</a> McAleenan’s statement.</p>
<p>Video and <a href="https://www.apnews.com/10024fd7ef884309801e7a1c159dc03e/gallery/media:a5fea3ce38e64457a69d7d7342bdd2ec">images</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/25/us/san-ysidro-port-of-entry-closed/index.html">showed</a> tear gas being used to disperse the crowds. In a statement posted on Facebook, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/179587888720522/posts/2230592780286679/">said</a>, “I want to thank those officers and agents in San Ysidro who, under tremendous strain, used professionalism and restraint to ensure that no one was injured as they were attacked themselves.”</p>
<p>The president, however, contradicted McAleenan’s and Nielsen’s statements. In answering reporters’ questions after a roundtable event in Mississippi on Nov. 26, Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-first-step-act-roundtable-governor-bryant-law-enforcement-leaders/">said&nbsp;</a>that “we had tremendous violence — three Border Patrol people yesterday were very badly hurt through getting hit with rocks and stones.”</p>
<p>We’ll update this story if we receive any further information about the president’s claim from the administration.</p>
<p>Trump also claimed that there are “over 500 people that are serious criminals and gang members” among the migrants in the caravan. Similarly, Nielsen said in her statement: “[A]<span>t this point we have confirmed that there are over 600 convicted criminals traveling with the caravan flow. This includes individuals known to law enforcement for assault, battery, drug crimes, burglary, rape, child abuse and more.”</span></p>
<p>But there is no evidence to support either claim.</p>
<p>We asked the White House and DHS for more information on those figures, including how the administration has identified those convicted criminals and whether the crimes were committed in the U.S. or other countries. We have not received a response.</p>
<p>Trump also repeated a claim he has made before, saying, “We’re building big parts of the wall.” He said the breach on Sunday was “in one area where the wall wasn’t quite built yet; it wasn’t completed. But the areas that have been completed have been very, very strong.” As <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/has-the-border-wall-begun/">we’ve explained before</a>, Congress has approved funding for some new fencing, but it’s far less than the wall Trump had touted during the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>The $1.6 billion in approved funding in the fiscal 2018 omnibus spending bill includes money to&nbsp;replace 14 miles of existing 8- to 10-foot high fencing in San Diego with 18- to 30-foot high bollard-style fences, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/border-wall-construction-project-starts-san-diego-sector">according to CBP</a>. But that’s not the kind of concrete wall Trump described during the campaign, and the funding is a fraction of the $25 billion the president requested.</p>

<p><span>In response to a question about climate change, President Donald Trump falsely claimed that the United States was “the cleanest we’ve ever been.” Data from a variety of sources show that while the country has made strides in the last decade, its carbon dioxide, or CO2, emissions are far from their lowest point.</span></p>

<p><b>Reporter, Nov. 26:</b><span> Mr. President, have you read the climate report yet?</span></p>
<p><b>Trump:</b><span> &nbsp;I’ve seen it, I’ve read some of it, and it’s fine. </span></p>
<p><b>Reporter:</b><span> They say economic impact could be devastating — of climate change.</span></p>
<p><b>Trump:</b><span> &nbsp;Yeah. I don’t believe it. </span></p>
<p><b>Reporter:</b><span> You don’t believe it?</span></p>
<p><b>Trump:</b><span> &nbsp;No. &nbsp;No. I don’t believe it. And here’s the other thing — you’re going to have to have China, and Japan, and all of Asia, and all of these other countries — you know, it — it addresses our country. </span></p>
<p><span>Right now, we’re at the cleanest we’ve ever been, and that’s very important to me. But if we’re clean but every other place on Earth on is dirty, that’s not so good. </span></p>
<p><span>So I want clean air. I want clean water. Very important. </span></p>
<p><span>Trump’s comments echo previous claims that the United States has the cleanest water and air, which we’ve </span><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/08/u-s-not-ranked-the-cleanest-country/"><span>previously debunked</span></a><span>. Compared to much of the world, America has enviable air and water, but it doesn’t rank as the “cleanest,” based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://epi.envirocenter.yale.edu/2018/report/category/hlt">2018 Environmental Performance Index.</a></span></p>
<p><span>This time, it isn’t entirely clear what the president means by “cleanest,” and the White House did not provide clarification. But when talking about climate change, the relevant metrics are greenhouse gases — particularly CO2, which is the </span><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/03/pruitt-on-climate-change-again/"><span>primary</span></a> <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/trump-official-wrong-warming/"><span>driver</span></a><span>. And here, the U.S. is neither tops in the world nor at its historical best.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the most comprehensive data about CO2 emissions come from the </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/"><span>Energy Information Administration</span></a><span>, or EIA. The agency reports on </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/mer.pdf"><span>energy-related CO2 emissions</span></a><span>, which includes things such as transportation, heating and electricity — and has been doing so since the early 1970s. Since </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/mer.pdf"><span>98 percent</span></a><span> of all CO2 emissions in the U.S. stem from the energy sector, this is a pretty good indication of the national trend. </span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/#environment"><span>data</span></a><span>, which we’ve graphed below, reveal that despite a promising downward slope, CO2 emissions are nowhere near their nadir. In 2017, U.S. carbon emissions were 5,144 million metric tons — the lowest it has been since 1992. But emissions were lower than that every year from 1973 through 1992.</span></p>

<p>One reason for the increase in emissions is a growing population — which improves the picture for the U.S. when measuring carbon emissions on a <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?locations=US&amp;year=1997">per-capita basis</a>. These values have tumbled after peaking in the early 1970s. But they are still higher than the lowest recorded points in the 1960s.<span>&nbsp;On both absolute and relative terms, then, it is false to claim that America is at its “cleanest.”</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat to these values is that they do not include other greenhouse gases or CO2 emissions from non-energy sources. </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks"><span>EPA data</span></a><span> does factor these in, but they only go back to 1990, making longer historical comparisons difficult — especially because this period is precisely when emissions begin to reach present-day levels.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, it is worth mentioning that the recent downward trend in CO2 emissions isn’t expected to continue in the short term. In October, the EIA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/archives/oct18.pdf">projected</a></span><span>&nbsp;that CO2 emissions will go up 2.2 percent in 2018. If that happens, it will be the first rise in carbon emissions since 2014.</span></p>
<p>The president also compared the U.S. to other countries when he said, “if we’re clean but every other place on Earth on is dirty, that’s not so good.”</p>
<p><span>Although the U.S. has made progress on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, it is by no means one of the lower emitters on the world stage.</span></p>
<p><span>Data from the International Energy Agency for 2016 show that the U.S. is second to China in its </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/statistics/?country=USA&amp;year=2016&amp;category=Key%20indicators&amp;indicator=CO2ByPop&amp;mode=map&amp;categoryBrowse=false&amp;dataTable=INDICATORS&amp;showDataTable=true"><span>total CO2 output</span></a><span>, followed by India, Russia, and Japan. </span><span>And the U.S. is higher than all of these countries in its </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/statistics/?country=USA&amp;year=2016&amp;category=Key%20indicators&amp;indicator=CO2ByPop&amp;mode=map&amp;categoryBrowse=false&amp;dataTable=INDICATORS&amp;showDataTable=true"><span>per-capita values</span></a><span>. In fact, America ranks 10th highest for its CO2 emissions per person, behind No. 1 Qatar, as well as Saudi Arabia and Australia. </span></p>
<p><span>So even though this number has fallen dramatically in the last decade, America is disproportionately contributing to climate change — far more than even China, which ranks 39th on a per-capita basis. </span></p>
<p><span>Other countries may need to reduce their CO2 emissions, but to say that the U.S. is already “clean” is false.</span></p>
