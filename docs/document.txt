"But little to my surprise, just in time for my son's winging, there not only came a signed photograph but, of course, a letter," Pence said. Bush was often known for sending handwritten letters to loved ones, friends and politicians, among others.

Pence said that within the letter, Bush told his son, "Though we have not met, I share the pride your father has for you during this momentous occasion, and I wish you many CAVU days ahead. All the best, G. Bush."

In addition to serving as president, Bush also served as a vice president for two terms under President Ronald Reagan. Pence said Bush joked that there was "nothing substantive to do at all" going into that job, but that he was "a sound counselor and loyal adviser to an outsider who came to Washington, D.C., to shake things up, cut taxes, rebuild the military, and together they did just that."
